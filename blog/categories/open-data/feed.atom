    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was curious how the physical parameters of Single Family Houses changed over time.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">assessment dataset</a> merged with the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/land_use/map">land use dataset</a>
allows to fairly accurately pick out single family houses, and also holds the age of most properies. Together with
the City of Vancouver LIDAR-generated building dataset <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/vancouver_lidar/map">that I have played with before</a>
we can look at physical building parameters.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The city dataset is a little coarse, it only contains the main building and does not map things like garages. It&rsquo;s a little
rough and should probably be interpreted cautiously on an individual building level. One could spend the time and derive the
building data directly from the raw LIDAR dataset optimized for this purpose, but for some overview statistics the building
dataset that was derived by the city is just fine. The LIDAR was taken in 2009, so we only consider houses built before that time.</p>

<h3>Site coverage</h3>

<p>One question is how the site coverage of the buildings have changed over time. We simply line up the buildings by the year
they were built, compute the site coverage of the main building relative to the parcel size and graph the quintiles for
each year. For good measure, we throw in the 10 and 90 percentile whiskers.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;" class="whiskers">
<div id="sfh_coverage" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/sfh_coverage.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin" style="padding-bottom:2em;">
</div>
</div>


<p>What jumps out immediately is that around 1988 there apparently was a change in zoning law that reduced site coverage
of the main building. <strike>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the history of building codes, maybe someone that does could shed some
light onto this.</strike> <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanDawe/status/706737206484795392">Twitter was fast to provide the answer</a>
it appears that changes in building code were implemented to counteract the growing footprint of houses at the time, details
can be found in <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0086386">Barbara Pettit&rsquo;s Ph.D. thesis</a>.</p>

<h3>Building Height</h3>

<p>The next obvious point of analysis is how building height, in meters, changed over time.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;" class="whiskers">
<div id="sfh_height" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/sfh_height.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin" style="padding-bottom:2em;">
</div>
</div>


<p>We observe a similar jump in the data around 1988, with building height jumping up as site coverage decreases.</p>

<h3>Building Volumes</h3>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at how &ldquo;massive&rdquo; the buildings are, measured by volume in cubic metres.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;" class="whiskers">
<div id="sfh_volume" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/sfh_volume.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin" style="padding-bottom:2em;">
</div>
</div>


<p>The graph does show that in general houses have gotten more massive starting in the late 80s, but after that have more or less
maintained the same volume. It shows that the combined effect of the regulation change in the late 80s that resulted in
smaller building footprints and taller buildings was that buildings overall got bulkier.</p>

<h3>Roof Type</h3>

<p>Lastly we see how the roof type changes over time, plotting the number of buildings with given roof type for each year.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;" class="whiskers">
<div id="sfh_roof" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/sfh_roof.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin" style="padding-bottom:2em;">
</div>
</div>


<p>Flat roofs seem to have been quite popular between the mid 60s to mid 80s.</p>

<h3>Length to Width Ratio (Update)</h3>

<p>A question about a regulation change in 1938 <a href="https://twitter.com/GRIDSVancouver/status/706879555550613504">came up on Twitter</a>,
so I thought I should check into the length-to-width ratio to see if anything can be seen there. A ratio of 1
would mean a square footprint, a ratio of 2 means the house is twice as long as wide.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;" class="whiskers">
<div id="sfh_square" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/sfh_square.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin" style="padding-bottom:2em;">
</div>
</div>


<p>No obvious changes around 1938, but our houses became a lot more square after the late 80s zoning changes.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>After starting to see what kind of data can be derived from LIDAR data we can start to explore different questions. The
graphs open a small window into the physical parameters of single family homes over time and are only of limited general
interest.</p>

<p>For
more serious analysis we would most likely have to start from the raw LIDAR data, which takes a little bit of effort.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/03/02/property-taxes-and-land-use/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-02T20:42:02-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/03/02/property-taxes-and-land-use</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I started thinking about <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/05/31/density-in-vancouver/">tax density</a>,
the amount of property taxes collected per area, I always felt that the data presentation in the map fell short.</p>

<p>Property taxes are somewhat insulated from the ups and downs of the real estate market as they are need-based and the mill
rate changes to flatten out the crazyness of the market. But what they lack in interesting patterns over time they more than
makes up for in interesting patterns in space.</p>

<p>To recognize these spacial patterns, one needs to switch layers in my
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.2741&amp;lng=-123.1321&amp;layer=10">assessment maps</a> and that&rsquo;s
a little awkward and most people won&rsquo;t do this.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember where I first saw some 3D data visualization around something like this, maybe in
<a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/11/18/mapping-the-effects-of-parking-minimums">this excellent Strong Towns post</a> that
explores tax density and parking.
When I was chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/dnproulx">Darren Proulx</a> about this I realized this is the perfect case
to rev up <a href="https://mapzen.com">Mapzen&rsquo;s awesone 3D map engine</a> for data visualization. Previously I had tried out the 3D
mapping capabilities to map
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/vancouver_lidar/map">the physical form of Vancouver&rsquo;s buildings obtained from LIDAR data</a>,
now it was time to map abstract data in 3D.</p>

<h3>3D Tax Density Maps</h3>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=14&lat=49.2814&lng=-123.1312" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/tax_density.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
The spacial patterns of tax density are closely related to zoning, so the obvious thing to do is to map both at the same
time. Tax density as the height and the zoning as the colour. But the relation between tax density and zoning is indirect,
it is given through land use. So when I
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/31/land-use/">folded the Metro Vancouver land use dataset into the asessment data</a>
I added another option to colour the map by land use. And the visualization works pretty well to show the relationship
between the variables.
Check out the <a class='btn' href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=14&lat=49.2814&lng=-123.1312" target="_blank">interactive map</a>.</p>

<h3>Some Quick Observations</h3>

<p>When comparing this to the <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/11/18/mapping-the-effects-of-parking-minimums">Strong Towns post</a>
mentioned above it is interesting to note that the &ldquo;tax contribution of bare pavement&rdquo; is actually quite high relative to
many other commercial properties. For example, the giant parking lot around Safeway on 10th near UBC can&rsquo;t be discerned
from the map. Similarly, Oakridge Mall does not stand out as a low tax area. That&rsquo;s basically because in today&rsquo;s property
market the value of the property is dictated by the land value and few properties, even few commercial properties outside
of downtown, have building values in the same order of magnitude as the land value.</p>

<p>And that keeps the pressure on to redevelop the low building value commercial stock, typically replacing it with mixed use.
One example is the Safeway on Granville and 70th, that went from parking lot to mixed use. The high land values make this
kind of redevelopment attractive. Typically this redevelopment process will raise commercial rents, lower commercial
property taxes, add housing supply and increase tax density.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=16&lat=49.2433&lng=-123.151" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/triangle.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Another interesting area is the
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=16&lat=49.2433&lng=-123.151" target="_blank">condo/apartment triangle at Arbutus and 33rd</a>.
These condos/apartments abut Quilchena Park, have a grocery store in proximity but otherwise sit in a see of single family housing.
I would like to highlight two alternative development models. One is the single family housing that surrounds this area,
the other is one where one takes the condo/apartment complex and throws in the adjacent Quilchena Park. The park does not
house any people and does not generate tax revenue but provides great recreational value. Overall, the tax density, that is the
amount of taxes collected per area, of those two models are the same. So the condo complex together with the entire park
collects the same amount of taxes per area as single family housing. On the other hand, the condo complex plus park houses
3 to 4 times as many people per (combined) area as the surrounding single family housing.</p>

<p>Presenting these as alternative
development models one can ask how many people would prefer condo (and one dedicated rental building) plus park over
single family housing without park.
Condo values range between $448k to $2.6m with median of $745k. 56% of all units have 2 bedrooms, 9% with 3 bedrooms.
The surrounding single family housing start at
around $2.5m for a teardown. My guess is that there are more people interested in the condo plus park model than the
current Vancouver market offers.</p>

<h3>More Detailed Analysis</h3>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s take the tax density information and measure it against city services rendered. In other words, let&rsquo;s see who
pays their &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; of property taxes. Well, that&rsquo;s where I ran out of juice. There is lots of
work involved to do it right, too much to fit into my evening side project time budget.</p>

<p>Some have done some
<a href="http://mapstoryblog.thenittygritty.org/costofstreets/">really amazing work</a> trying to understand the give and take of
property taxes and services rendered, to the bar is pretty high.</p>

<p>Vancouver&rsquo;s situation, with the commercial property tax 5x the residential rate, has it&rsquo;s own quirks to add to the
complexity.</p>

<p>If someone is interested in spending the time to sieve through the city budget and process the data I would be happy to help out
with graphing and mapping. As long as the data is clean enough that it stays under my &ldquo;one evening side project time budget&rdquo;. :-)</p>

<h3>Looking Forward</h3>

<p>General public awareness about taxes, zoning and fairness seem to be rising. Recently a
<a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/02/8540903/lawsuit-claims-discrimination-real-estate-taxes">class action alleging discrimination in New York&rsquo;s property tax code</a>
was launched. An interesting precedent, and it will be interesting to watch the outcome.
And to see how this could apply to the tax and services balance
of low density vs high density. Or exclusionary zoning policies as the motor of unequal tax density.
Or minimum parking requirements which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/03/03/how-parking-requirements-hurt-the-poor/">disproportionally hurt poor people</a>.</p>

<p>As this kind of data becomes more publicly accessible and better visualizations make this complex issue more
accessible I expect these kind of questions to gain more traction.</p>

<h5>I can&rsquo;t view the 3D map!</h5>

<p>Sorry. Welcome to the world of modern web technology. (WebGL in this case.) If you try to look at the interactive map and don&rsquo;t see anything like the image above, then that&rsquo;s probably because
you either have and old (windows?) computer and/or an old (Internet Explorer) browser. If switching to Chrome or Firefox does
not fix this for you your best option is to cramp that map into your phone screen. Your phone is probably newer and supports
modern web technology much better than your computer. Or you can always view the 2D maps linked above.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/02/29/land-use/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-29T21:10:05-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/02/29/land-use</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day at the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/publicsquare/upcoming-events/city-conversations/2016/Feb-18-2016.html">SFU&rsquo;s City Conversations</a>
someone asked a question about space dedicated to roads, and how that could be unlocked
to aid housing. He mentioned what percentage of space is currently dedicated to roads. I forgot the number,
but I thought to myself that I should look that up for all Metro Vancouver communities. So here we go.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Actually, it would be interesting to compare how land is allocated to all kinds of land uses across Metro Vancouver, not just roads.
And with their excellent
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/31/land-use/">land use dataset</a> it&rsquo;s easy enough to do, justifying spending
two hours on this. <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/land_use/map">Looking at the land use map</a>
one can see that there are some issues with using the dataset for
that purpose, for example the roads within
Stanly Park are missing, as parking lots in Vancouver parks. So this slightly overestimates the green space. But when
added up this won&rsquo;t do much to change the overall area of each land use.</p>

<h3>Land Use Breakdown</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a simple chart summing up the land use in each of Metro Vancouver&rsquo;s Municipalities. Just select the one
you are interested in from the dropdown.</p>

<div id="land_use_breakdown" class="land_use"></div>


<p>City of Vancouver stands out as the municipality with the largest proportion of area dedicated to roads right of way.
The right of way includes nature strips, sidewalks, and of course on-street parking.</p>

<h3>Built Area Land Use</h3>

<p>For some of the municipalities large &ldquo;Natural Areas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Undeveloped Area&rdquo; make it difficult to discern the makeup of
the built up areas. So here comes the same graph with some of the large space-cosuming categories taken out.</p>

<div id="land_use_breakdown2" class="land_use"></div>


<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable is that City of Vancouver still is the clear winner in terms of space taken up by roads right of way.</p>

<h3>Roads right of way</h3>

<p>It might be interesting to compute more precisely how the roads right of way is used. But that requires a lot more work.
The City of Vancouver has a dataset with road widths, which would help separate area taken by roads from area taken by
sidewalks and nature strips. One could use google maps to estimate to estimate the amount of space taking up by on-street
parking by sampling a couple of roads and scaling this according to road area. Too much work for me right now, maybe one day I will
have a good enough reason to dedicate some time to this.</p>

<h3>Parking</h3>

<p>Parking in particular is a land use that is artificially inflated. We pay lots of money to buy private property to live
on, and then continue to pay property taxes for that privilege. But we pay nothing to store our vehicles on public roads.</p>

<p>At current land values in Vancouver it just does not make any sense to socialize the cost of parking. A 12m&sup2; on-street
parking space at a low-balled $3000/m&sup2; value is worth $36,000. If we were to price parking at value, rather than
socializing the cost we could have a discussion about using that space more effectively. Killing the parking subsidy
would have a substantial impact on demand (and car ownership), freeing up space to be re-allocated for other uses. For
example for housing by increasing lot sizes and making multi-unit structures more feasible, especally on corner lots.</p>

<hr>


<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/d3visualization/status/705421356222029824">great little data visualization fly by today</a> that
is just the missing link in the above visualizations. A simple way to visualize where all the municipalities stand in
relation to one another. Thought I would throw that in real quick.</p>

    <updated>2016-02-10T11:01:47-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/02/10/on-condos</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lots has been said about the upper end of owned dwellings. The movement of the &ldquo;million dollar line&rdquo;, the emergence of
the &ldquo;two million dollar line&rdquo; and &ldquo;multi-million dollar lines&rdquo;. Most of that discussion is focused on
<a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=sfh" target="_blank">single detached homes</a> or on proxies for &ldquo;single detached&rdquo; like
<a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=rs" target="_blank">RS zoned properties</a>.</p>

<p>But all of these maps have a clear bias toward the more expensive homes. Everyone knows by now where the most expensive properties
are. But where are the more affordable ones?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Before continuing and getting disappointed at the end, we want to highlight the huge limitations when looking for affordable homes.
There is no freely available data on the
floor area or number of bedrooms for each dwelling unit. Next to the price and location (which we have), these are the most
important features of a dwelling. And this limits the usefulness of all that follows.</p>

<p>Why continue? It gives a glimpse of what kind of analysis could be done if the information would be <em>freely</em> available.</p>

<h3>The Elephant in the Room</h3>

<p>In principle all this information is available, <a href="https://twitter.com/bcassessment">BCAssessment</a> has all this data. And they even make it
<a href="http://evaluebc.bcassessment.ca/Default.aspx#">available on their (quite nice) eValue website</a>. But their terms of use
prevent us and others from using this information. Most of the information used in the analysis here originates from BCAssessment,
but it comes via the City of Vancouver that has made the data available through their open data portal.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the main reason why this data is not freely available is that BCAssessment is charged to recover their
own operating cost. So they hold onto their data and try to sell it for cost recovery. In the process of which they harm
the ability of municipalities to plan properly and the public to get a clear idea where things are at and have a fact-based
discussion on how to move forward. Which creates large amounts of friction and may lead to social and economic damages far
exceeding any revenue collected by BCAssessment.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t believe that holding back data is a smart way to run a government. You might want to
<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=@bcassessment Please add %23openData license to information you publish on eValue! %23giveUsData" target="_blank">ask BCAssessment to #giveUsData</a>.</p>

<p>For now, let&rsquo;s put the data that we do have to the best use and see what we can tease out.</p>

<h3>Locating the Most Affordable Dwellings</h3>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/101" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/strata.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
Stating the obvious, the most affordable homes aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;single detached&rdquo;, they are condos. And condos have been largely
absent from the affordability debate, although they make up the majority of owned dwelling units in the City of Vancouver.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with a <a href="http://mountainmath.ca/map/special/101" target="_blank">map of the roughly 4,500 stratified residential or mixed use properties in Vancouver housing a total of about 10,2000 strata units</a>.
The exact numbers are hard to pin down. (<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=@bcassessment Please add %23openData license to information you publish on eValue! %23giveUsData" target="_blank">#giveUsData</a>)</p>

<p>The distribution of stratified units by the total number of strata units
per building gives an idea of the types of strata units that are out there.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_strata_by_number" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/strata_by_number.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin">
  <p><i style="background:steelblue"></i> Number of strata units by size of strata <span style="float:right;margin-right:10px;" id="unit_counts_value"></span></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The horizontal axis is not linear, and the bin sizes are not equal, which makes the graph a little difficult to read. We chose bins at
2, 4, 8, 10, 16, 20 at the low end, then of width 10 up to 200, from there width 20 up to 300 and then 400, 500 and 700 at
the top end. Lazy me apologizes for the poor graphic.</p>

<p>We immediately notice the 4,152 strata units in stratas with exactly 2 units usually referred to as &ldquo;duplexes&rdquo;.
There are a lot of strata units are in stratas of size between 20 and 50, but
otherwise the units are fairly well distributed over different building sizes. At the high end there are fewer buildings,
but each with lots of units. So there our graph becomes a little jerky and heavily depends on the cutoffs we choose.</p>

<p>To get a basic idea on how much these units cost we plot the number of strata units by price bracket.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_strata_by_price" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/strata_by_price.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin">
  <p><i style="background:steelblue"></i> Number of strata units by price <span style="float:right;margin-right:10px;" id="affordable_value"></span></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The distribution looks largely as one would expect. It peaks between the $400k and $500k mark, with a median value of
$482,000. But there are a couple of things that jump out. Firstly, there are suspiciously many condos
below $100k, more than half of which (445 to be precise), are less than $50k. There are places where one could by
a condo for that price, but not in Vancouver. These are stratified parking spaces or other amenity spaces.</p>

<p>Next let&rsquo;s focus in on the 8,313 duplex and multi-plex units with 8 or fewer units (in 2,995 buildings) and plot these
separately.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_multiplex_by_price" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/multiplex.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin">
  <p><i style="background:steelblue"></i> Number of multiplex units by price <span style="float:right;margin-right:10px;" id="multiplex_value"></span></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>We see that the price distribution for multiplex units peaks at a higher price between $800k and $900k, but the overall
numbers are quite small when compared to all strata units.</p>

<h3>Affordable Strata Units</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to understand where the &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; housing stock is, which we take to be units below $500k, or roughly the
bottom half of the distribution. We would like to map the properties containing housing
units for each of our price brackets, but this gets tricky since the dataset does not hold
information which units are parking spaces and which are commercial.</p>

<p>We need to take care of the problem with needing to distinguish parking spaces from housing units. And from commercial units.
(<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=@bcassessment Please add %23openData license to information you publish on eValue! %23giveUsData" target="_blank">#giveUsData</a>) So we are left with
using proxies, so let&rsquo;s set a cutoff price so that most units below are parking stalls and most units above are (residential)
units.</p>

<p>Generally, parking spaces should not cost more than $50,000 which is roughly the cost to build underground
parking. Around $40,000 if it&rsquo;s only one level, getting up to $75,000 (or sometimes even more) when having to go down deeper or water becomes an issue. The
fact that some spaces go for significantly less is the result of mandatory parking minimums. Some parking spaces may be worth
more than $100,000 as some people are willing to pay a premium for a convenient spot. That may mean a spot next to the
elevator by the exit ramp, or simply a parking spot in a specific building that is under supplied and trekking across the
street to a spot somewhere else is inconvenient enough. Or some stratified parking spaces might consist of several
parking spots.</p>

<h3>Location of Affordable Condos</h3>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/110" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/strata_500k.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
Since it is impossible to pick out the housing units out of all the strata units, all we can do is map all strata units,
understanding that
those below $50k are most likely parking spaces, those between $50k and $100k could be parking or housing (or commercial) and the
majority of units above $100k are housing.</p>

<p>And we can&rsquo;t actually map the individual units, only the buildings that house the units. Here are maps of the buildings
housing the units in each of the lower brackets.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/41" target="_blank">&lt; $100k (715 units in 17 buildings)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/42" target="_blank">$100k &ndash; $200k (2,415 units in 198 buildings)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/43" target="_blank">$200k &ndash; $300k (10,270 units in 644 buildings)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/44" target="_blank">$300k &ndash; $400k (19,128 units in 1,112 buildings)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/45" target="_blank">$400k &ndash; $500k (20,538 units in 1,219 buildings)</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Clickin into a particular building and hitting the &ldquo;more&rdquo; button will pull up (a slightly cleaned) tax roster where you
can get more information on the units. And if you are really interested in finding out more about a particular one
you can always <a href="http://evaluebc.bcassessment.ca/Default.aspx#">head on over to BCAssessment&rsquo;s eValue website</a> to look up
more of those details that BCAssessment keeps in public view but locked off from systematic public scrutiny.
(<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=@bcassessment Please add %23openData license to information you publish on eValue! %23giveUsData" target="_blank">#giveUsData</a>)</p>

<h3>Makeup of Condos</h3>

<p>The built quality of strata units is generally higher, dollar for dollar, than that of single family homes. This should not
come as a surprise as land is very expensive and stata units tend to use land more efficiently. There are only 27 residential
or mixed use strata buildings that classify as <em>teardowns</em>,
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/18/redevelopment/">with a teardown coefficient below 5%</a>.
And 25 of these are duplexes, one is a 3-plex and one an 8-plex. There are no condos buildings with more than 8 units that
fit our most restrictive definition of <em>teardown</em>.</p>

<p>Next we explore what kind of buildings the affordable units are in by graphing the number of units in several price ranges
per size of the strata building it is in.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_affordable_strata_by_number" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/affordable_strata_by_number.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin">
</div>
</div>


<p>It looks like buildings with 20 to 60 units are quite good at producing affordable units. Partially that&rsquo;s due to their
abundance, but graphing the percentage of units in each price bracket confirms that these buildings tend to produce a
nice mixture of low and high value condos. But larger condo buildings can also achieve this, although the actual performance
of what has been built is mixed. Other factors, for example building age, are likely also at play here.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_percentage_affordable_strata_by_number" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/percentage_affordable_strata_by_number.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin">
</div>
</div>


<p>To see what the distribution of strata units by age is, we use the same price cutoffs and sort the strata units into age
brackets. Since we are mostly interested in the more affordable units we sort out units in buildings with 4 or fewer units.
These units might skew some of the age brackets.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_affordable_strata_by_age" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/affordable_strata_by_age.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin">
</div>
</div>


<p>To highlight the proportional makeup we again and graph this again as percentages.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_percentage_affordable_strata_by_age" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/percentage_affordable_strata_by_age.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin">
</div>
</div>


<p>We see how generally the percentage of more affordable units increases with the age of the building. Newer units generally
tend to be more expensive at first and becoming more affordable over time as the building ages.</p>

<h3>Taking Stock</h3>

<p>If you read this far you probably agree that this exercise was mostly a waste of time. Hopefully you are earger to see this
analysis split up by number of bedrooms and floor area. If you are all riled up at the lack of data and BCAssessment
not giving out this information with a clean open data license you might want to drop them a line and
<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=@bcassessment Please add %23openData license to information you publish on eValue! %23giveUsData" target="_blank">ask for at least the information they publish eValue to be made available with an #openData license!</a></p>

<p>I am still hopeful that this might happen some day, and we can get a much better picture of the buildings in BC cities
and check how they perform in fulfilling the needs of the community. And learn from that to make informed policy choices.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the heart of the Vancouver affordabiliy crisis is a phrase that comes up again and again. <em>Loss of Character</em>. To effectively
move forward I think it is important to look closely what it means and how it is used.</p>

<p>And what the data can tell us about <em>loss of character</em>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Loss of Character</h3>

<p>Very broadly interpreted, <em>change of character</em> is how people describe the process when
the environment around them is changing in profound ways. And the neighbourhoods in Vancouver are indeed changing fast.</p>

<p><em>Loss of character</em>, as opposed to <em>change of character</em>, adds a value judgement. It implies that the former &ldquo;character&rdquo;
was preferable to the new one.</p>

<p>I want to highlight two ways in which this change manifests itself in Vancouver: Change in buildings and change in demographics.</p>

<h3>Change in buildings</h3>

<p>There has been a lot of focus on buildings getting torn down and rebuilt. When a city runs out of land to build new housing,
part of the existing stock will get increasingly cannibalized to make space for new buildings. It pays off to try and
understand how this renewal process works.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the age distribution of Vancouver&rsquo;s single family homes.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_sfh" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/sfh_age.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin"></div>
</div>


<p>We divided the building stock for each age into two groups, one with building value less than 5% of the total property
value, and one with building value greater than 5%. The significance of that number is that historically over the last
10 years, buildings with this precentage below 5% <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/18/redevelopment/">had a 1 in 6 change of being torn down and rebuilt</a>
over a 10 year time frame, with sharply dropping frequency of tear downs of buildings above that threshold. Check the link
for a more detailed analysis.</p>

<p>We interpret this graph as giving us a decent prediction of what part of our building stock will get torn down and rebuilt
in the next 10 years, 1 in 6 of the red is predicted to go.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable is that essentially the entire SFH stock built between 1935 and 1965 is at high risk of being torn down,
while the period before that has a much better chance of surviving. This comes out of purely looking at the data, it would
be helpful if people out there that understand
the characteristics of the homes built at different times could shed some light onto why this maybe be the case.</p>

<p>Appreciating some of the economic drivers of this process, we can try to understand how people feel about the process.
There seem to be several different reactions to and thoughts on buildings being torn down
that can be summed up with the words &lsquo;heritage&rsquo;, &lsquo;waste&rsquo; and &lsquo;McMansion&rsquo;.</p>

<h4>Heritage</h4>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/11?zoom=13&amp;lat=49.264&amp;lng=-123.1276&amp;layer=4&amp;filter=sfh"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/heritage.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
Some feel strongly about &lsquo;heritage homes&rsquo; which typically goes beyond the
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/11?zoom=13&amp;lat=49.264&amp;lng=-123.1276&amp;layer=4">City of Vancouver list of heritage sites</a>
or more specifically the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/11?zoom=13&amp;lat=49.264&amp;lng=-123.1276&amp;layer=4&amp;filter=sfh">single family houses on that list</a>.
The term is used differently by different people and may be confined to offical heritage sites, or ones that have been
&lsquo;overlooked&rsquo; and should be part of that list, to houses of a certain age or style (&ldquo;cottage homes&rdquo;), to including pretty
much anything old or decent looking like this <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/business/bulldozer+bait+million+mansion+just+another+vancouver+tear+down/11686111/story.html?__lsa=8524-b4e7">1996 building that made the news recently</a>.
Many of those heritage sites are well kept up, with a teardown coefficient well above 5%. But there are also some in quite desolate
state.</p>

<p>Most people see value in heritage, for this term to be a more usefuly driver in the discussion it would greatly help to
narrow it down.</p>

<h4>Waste</h4>

<p>Another narrative is that of &lsquo;waste&rsquo;, when a house gets sent to the landfill. And waste is an issue everyone
is concerned about, land fill space is limited and the impact of the building industry is huge,
<a href="http://www.bcbusiness.ca/real-estate/disposable-housing-vancouver-home-demolition">as described in this 2011 article</a>.
The City of Vancouver has enacted some rules on <a href="http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/demolition-permit.aspx">how much of a building needs to be recycled</a>,
but they are very weak. In particular, there are no binding recycling requirements at all for post 1940 houses beyond recycling drywall.
Generally the sentiment seems to be more concerned with the fact that a building is getting
torn down, rather than focused on how to improve the process of salvaging and recycling the old home.</p>

<p>The good news is that most of the teardown activity in Vancouver has been
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/18/redevelopment/">focusing on low relative building value properties</a>, so
cases like the demolition of <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/business/bulldozer+bait+million+mansion+just+another+vancouver+tear+down/11686111/story.html?__lsa=8524-b4e7">that 1996 building assessed at $1.9m</a>
are quite rare. That building has a teardown coefficient of 25%, and historically buildings in that range had a 1 in 200
chance of being torn down in a 10 year period.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s concerning though is that as land values increase, so do the value (dollar amount) of the buildings that move into
the high-risk category of teardown coefficient below 5%.</p>

<h4>McMansion</h4>

<p>The last important word is &lsquo;McMansion&rsquo;, which tackles the question of what the building gets replaced with. Typically
the term &lsquo;McMansion&rsquo; is used for a building whose primary concern is to maximize the allowable footprint.
Economically speaking, this is a rational reaction to the exorbitant land values. Esthetically it can be quite jarring.</p>

<p>This is where the value judgement in &ldquo;<em>loss</em> of character&rdquo; becomes most apparent. While some people feel visually offended
by them, people that buy these properties clearly prefer them over what was there before. Either way, they serve as constant
reminders of the change the neighbourhoods are experiencing.</p>

<h3>Change in Demographics</h3>

<p>Probably more important than the change in buildings is the change in demographics. Vancouver seems to be experiencing
a gentrification process where the traditional financial elite of &lsquo;high income&rsquo; households is priced out of the market by the new
financial elite of &lsquo;high net worth&rsquo; households. That change is dramatic and it has been going on for long enough now to
have left very visible signs in the 2011 Census data.</p>

<p><a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/37"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/local_affordability.png" style="width:50%;float:right;"></a>
Looking at the <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/37">&lsquo;local affordability&rsquo; in Vancouver</a> in 2011 we see that in many (not all)
neighbourhoods the people that live there could
not afford to buy again (based on their income). What that means is simply that the people moving in will be demographically
very different from the ones living there right now. And yes, this problem is much worse in Vancouver than in other places in
Canada, which can easily be seen by searching and panning in the map.</p>

<p>This problem has likely gotten much worse since, as housing prices continued to climb much more steeply than income since 2011.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
Another indicator of just how disconnected the property market, especially that of single family homes, is from the
local economy is that the combined rise of land value of all single family homes combined was $24.6bn, more than the entire
population of Vancouver combined income through work, investment (other than housing) or registered retirement income and
government transfer payments during that year. Even considering pre-tax income (although the housing price increase is tax free for all those
living in their house the year before they sell). <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/24/work-vs-twiddling-thumbs/">Read here more details on this</a>
or <a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12">browse through the map</a> to see
just how much each Vancouver homeowner made last year twiddling thumbs and waiting for land values to rise.</p>

<p>So how can people still buy in this market? Except for the rare cases of people with very large salaries to be able to save
large sums for down payments and handle the mortgage payments, those purchases are founded in wealth, not income. Local wealth,
maybe inherited or handed down from parents when they cached out on their home, or money brought in from abroad.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s clear is that this wealth-based gentrification process is real and rapidly changing the social character of the
neighbourhoods.</p>

<h3>Hard truths</h3>

<ol>
<li>We can&rsquo;t stop teardowns. The economic drivers are too strong. We can do better at designating and preserving heritage
sites and nudging the process in other ways. Naively projecting past data forward
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/18/redevelopment/">we predict around 8,000 properties will be torn down and rebuilt</a>
in the next 10 years.</li>
<li>Affordable single family homes are a thing of the past. Demand is growing and supply is shrinking, so prices will
remain high and nothing short of Soviet-style interventions can change that.</li>
<li>Housing in many neighbourhoods is now out of reach for working professionals that can&rsquo;t rely on outside financial help
like inheritance or mortgages backed by the assets of their parents.</li>
<li>Foreign money may have played some role in getting us here, but any solution that solely revolves around dealing with
foreign money won&rsquo;t solve the problem. (Someone should run some
custom tabulations through Stats Canada to get a better handle on the signs of foreign money that can be picked up from the basic 2011
Census data.)</li>
</ol>


<h3>Preserving and Restoring Character (my 2c)</h3>

<p>Looking forward, how can the character of the neighbourhoods be preserved or restored? Most of the public discussion
focuses on the how to preserve the build form; the question how to preserve the
social structure of the neighbourhoods receives much less attention.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a good overview about what ideas are out there, so I won&rsquo;t attempt to summarize them. Usually I try to focus
on data and keep my opinions out of this, but I could not help myself on this one. So here comes my 2c on what should be done.</p>

<h4>Character of Buildings</h4>

<p>For buildings, we need to focus on what&rsquo;s important to
preserve. We need better rules on building waste. And we need to create policies that guide what teardowns will replace.</p>

<h4>Social Character</h4>

<p>To preserve and restore the social character of the neighbourhoods we need to create housing for the types of people that
used to be able to buy in the neighbourhood and are now being pushed out. That is working professionals. Given that single
family houses will remain out of reach, the only way to do that is to allow (low rise) condos in neighbourhoods. I don&rsquo;t know
if that means just upzoning arterials, or creating pockets of low-rise throughout neighbourhoods like it is common in my
<img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/arbutus-33.png" style="width:50%;float:right;">
native Germany. One example of this in Vancouver is the low-rise pocket at Arbutus and 33rd.
That complex, when taken together with all of Quilchena park, still houses roughly 3 times more people per area than the typical
single family housing neighbourhood with the same total area. And it collects the same amount of property taxes
per square metre as the typical single family neighbourhood (without a park) while it is cheaper to service.</p>

<p>Alternatives, like encouraging laneway houses and secondary suites can also increase supply and help ease the housing crunch.
They are great at increasing rental stock. But they don&rsquo;t increase supply fast enough, don&rsquo;t serve the
demand for home ownership and scatter up the green space into lots of tiny yards instead of freeing up space for larger
parks that can be effectively used for kids to play and recreation. Focusing only on towers instead just intensifies the
gentrification process, but there probably are areas where they make sense. There is no doubt that increasing supply
has to be part of the solution, any ideas like <a href="https://pricetags.wordpress.com/2016/01/31/qa-on-the-toughest-topic-in-town/">&lsquo;downzoning&rsquo;</a>
that fail to increase supply are counterproductive in restoring the social character of the neighbourhoods.</p>

<p><a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/88?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.2395&amp;lng=-123.1518"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/child_household_density.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
If we are concerned about creating space for families the question becomes where to house them. With land limited, let&rsquo;s
map the density of households with children, so the <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/88?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.2395&amp;lng=-123.1518">number of households with children per km&sup2;</a>.
We immediately see that the existing pockets of mid and high-rise are very effective at housing children households. Using
Census data to model presence of children in households on physical housing parameters we see that having 3 or more bedrooms
is the single most determening factor. If accommodating families is a priority, then we need to ensure that all neighbourhoods
have 3 bedroom options, <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/97">which is currently not the case (2011 data)</a>.</p>

<h4>Dealing with a Wealth-based market</h4>

<p>Moving from a housing market supported by income to one supported by wealth, either of domestic or foreign origin, requires
new rules to ensure fairness and preserve the basic social contract that our society is founded on: That everyone starts
out with more or less the same opportunities, and work and grit can lead to social and economic upward mobility.</p>

<p>Wealth, especially foreign wealth, tends to be much more mobile and can decide on short notice to leave Vancouver. This introduces
enormous risks to the local economy, and smart policies are needed to guard against these risks.</p>

<p>In Canada, people don&rsquo;t pay capital gains on their primary residence. That works fine as long as increases
in land value are relatively low, but with current situation where people <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/24/work-vs-twiddling-thumbs/">earn more money sitting on their house than
actually working</a> the idea that income from
work should be taxes and income from twiddling thumbs should not is just ludicrous. Let&rsquo;s tax all capital gains on housing.
We can deduct investments into improvements and can argue about details like indexing taxable gains to inflation. And
let&rsquo;s tax it at a rate that is higher than the one on income or investments in stocks to re-focus housing as being treated
primarily to house people and not as investment.</p>

<p>This train of thought is similar in nature to the
<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/bc-professors-call-for-property-surtax-on-vacant-vancouver-housing/article28235302/">Vacant Housing Tax</a>
in that it would have minimal direct impact
on the market (so it in itself won&rsquo;t bring prices down in a meaningful way), but it would generate substantial amounts of revenue
that could be used to provide relief. And the revenue is large enough that, if spent strategically (for example on building
affordable rental), could have a meaningful impact on the overall property market. And restore fairness in a market where
initial captial barriers are so high only the rich can participate.</p>

<p>Next, with the property market driven by wealth (especially for single family houses), while the way we finance
public services is based on income, we need to ask the question if our current taxation system is still adequate. A capital
gains tax on housing is just one part of this, the proposal to tax vacant properties is another. We could strengthen
legislation and enforcement on foreign income, assuming that this is a big enough issue (Give us better data!).
Other options that should get discussed are a higher property transfer tax, progressive property taxes
(possibly discounted against income tax) and other measures that pay more attention to the role of wealth vs income in
the Vancouver property market. This discussion is important, but requires better data to be meaningful and effective.</p>

<h4>Data</h4>

<p>The profound lack of data is a major problem to find effective ways to fix the affordability crisis. Lack of clear data
can provide a convenient excuse for inaction.</p>

<p>But data does not need to be perfect.<br/>
Much can be learned from the data at hand. A good list of data sources and reproducible findings would be a great way
to establish a baseline, build better arguments and keep the discussion focused on the &ldquo;big fish&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Maybe a dedicated github repro could provide a suitable format for this.</p>
