    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Next steps in CensusMapper</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">Census Mapper Project</a> is moving along slowly, public beta unearthed some bugs and we gathered
feedback (thanks to everyone reporting back!). There are still a couple of steps that need to be taken care of before
we can unleash the full map making power to all users. We feel that the complexity of census data requires more guidance
than the current map making system is providing. Anyone who does not mind getting there hands dirty and having to look
up census variable definitions by themselves when making maps is welcome to contact us and we will hook you up with a
beta mapmaking account.</p>

<p>In the meantime we added one important feature to the CensusMapper.</p>

<h5>Content Drilldown</h5>

<p>CensusMapper is a great way to explore single census variables (or a single function built out of census variables)
across many geographic regions and aggregation levels. But sometimes we would like to do the opposite: Drill down into
a specific census region and explore other census variables. We have now added an easy way to do this. To access it
simply select the &ldquo;more&rdquo; button in the basic popup when you select a census region. This brings up the <em>census wheel</em>,
which is our way to navigate through census data.
<img src="/images/wheel.png" alt="Census Wheel" /></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are almost 4,000 census variables available, right now we do not offer to split up by gender, which reduces the
available variables to 1,429. To further simplify things we throw out all variables with zero values, still leaving
sizeable number of variables to browse through. Each arc in the census wheel represents a variable, or a category of
variables. Selecting an arc will zoom into that arc and make it into the &ldquo;center&rdquo; of the wheel, collapsing all other
components. That the content <em>drilldown</em> process. Once it makes sense to display data as proportions, we switch to the
<em>proportional view</em> which shows the data as hierarchical pie chart.
<img href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/mother_tounge.png" alt="Mother Tounge" style="max-width=400px"/>
This gives a visual representation of the proportions of each of the variables. Hovering (or touching) an arc will
display more detailed information, selecting one will drill down further. To reverse that process either select the
center or us the <em>content breadcrumbs</em> at the top that were created during the drilldown process.</p>

<h5>Data Problems</h5>

<p>Census data is messy. Now that all census data for each region is generally accessible in CensusMapper we need to
explain some of the inherent data problems.</p>

<h6>Rounding</h6>

<p>Census Canada will <a href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/help-aide/N2.cfm?Lang=E">round</a>
(almost) all data to preserve anonymity and don&rsquo;t create false impressions of accuracy that
the data does not achieve. Data is generally reported in increments of 5 or 10, but rounding is not done in the generally
understood deterministic way but includes randomness to preserve anonymity. In most cases, the value of the real variable
is within 5 (or 10) of the reported one. Rounding leads to situations where for example the sum of all people listed
by age bracket will not add up to the total number of people. Generally, this difference will be small and we ignore it
in our visualization.</p>

<h6>Omitted Data</h6>

<p>Census Canada will at times not report data. This could be due to very low return rates or other problems that make data
so unreliable that it is better not reported at all. Or it could be that releasing the information would reveal
information that that would compromize the anonymity of the census data for some people in that area. The latter can take
the form of Census Canada not reporting any data for the region, or Census Canada zeroing out specific variables that
&ldquo;are too low to be reported&rdquo;. We have not been able to find clear guidelines how this works, but often this will leave
detectable traces in the data. For example, looking at &ldquo;African Origins&rdquo; only &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; had non-zero values for
&ldquo;North African Origin&rdquo;.
<img src="/images/unaccounted.png" alt="Unaccounted" />
In this example there were 125 people with &ldquo;North African Origins&rdquo;, but only 105 people with &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; origin. That
leaves 20 people unaccounted for. This is outside of the range that could be explained by the rounding of the variables,
there must have been other North African origins that were too small to be reported on. We alert the user by adding in
a grey area for the missing 20. This also ensures that the visible representation remains accurate.</p>

<h6>Multiple Responses</h6>

<p>Some census questions allow for multiple responses. For exaple &ldquo;Language Spoken Most Often At Home&rdquo;. In this particular
case the census variable breaks out single responses and multiple responses and is very transparent to the user. In
other cases, for example &ldquo;Ethnicity&rdquo;, single and multiple responses are not reported separately but responses are all
added up. This leads to the sum of lower level variables being higher than the base variable. We alert the user to this
by overlaying small white dots on the base variable.
<a href="/images/multiple_responses.png">Multiple Responses</a>
In this particular case the total for for &ldquo;Ethnic Origin&rdquo; was 12,140 people. But there were 1,430 more responses at the
next level, so up to 1,430 people had given multiple responses to this question listing more than one of the aggregate
(mostly continent level) origins, some possibly listing more than two. The same patter repeats at different aggregation
levels, for example 2,565 people claimed at least one of the &ldquo;British Island origins&rdquo;, but many listed more than one
resulting in the sum of the individual regions with the British Islands exceeding the British Island count by 1,445.
Again, we alert the user by overlaying dots over the &ldquo;British Island origins&rdquo; arc. Hovering over the arg will display
the exact numbers of the &ldquo;overcounting&rdquo; due to multiple responses.</p>

<h6>Basic Census</h6>

<p>The Basic Census is generally speaking quite reliable, every single person is required to fill it
out and return rates are generally above 95%. Serious problems will only occur if response rates are very low. We alert
the user by shading geographic regions is this has been the case.</p>

<h6>NHS</h6>

<p>The National Household Survey is quite different in nature, it was only
sent out to a smaller portion (~30%) of society and return rates were much lower (~61%). Even with 100% return rates
there are likely to be geographic regions where the results severely misrepresent reality in that region due to sampling
bias. For each region that bias is small, but the probability for bias grows as the number of people in the geographic
region declines. So this is mostly a problem of Dissemination Areas. But even there, the probability of severe sampling
bias in each region is small, but there are many regions and the probability that some of these regions suffer from
sever sampling bias is quite large. And we don&rsquo;t know which regions they are.</p>

<p>On top of this basic statistical sampling bias, we also have self selection bias due to some deomgraphics being more
likely to return the survey than others. The return rates can give some indication of the likelyhood of self-selection
bias, we shade regions with a non-return rate lower than 50%, the cutoff Census Canada set for reliability of the NHS.
This cutoff is just a guideline, the return rates should always to be taken into account when interpreting results,
especially at the Dissemination Area level.</p>

<p>If all this information did not turn you off, head over to <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">CensusMapper</a> and drill down into
some geographic areas.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h5>We are excited to announce CensusMapper public beta launch!</h5>

<p>The project on mapping census data for Canada is entering the next stage. We are now mapping 3875 different
variables from the 2011 census, or any combination of them, across 67215 geographic regions covering all of Canada.</p>

<p>We are opening up the <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">Census Mapper</a> to a limited public beta. Limited means that anyone
can view maps created in CensusMapper, but we are only opening up the map creation tools to selected beta users.</p>

<p>Be aware that the web app makes use of modern web technology and renders large amount of data. It will only work on
modern browsers, best viewed in Chrome or Safari. Firefox works ok, Internet Explorer might grind to a halt and should be avoided.</p>

<p><a href="http://censusmapper.ca"><img src="/images/map-tools.jpg" alt="CenusMap Mapmaker" /></a></p>

<p>We are a little restrictive on creating maps right now for the simple reason that census data is somewhat tricky to
understand and at this point we don&rsquo;t have a comprehensive guide explaining all the variables and warning against many
of the pitfalls. We are planning to slowly integrate this and open up the map creation tools to the general public.</p>

<h3>Why CensusMapper?</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>Census Canada data is extremely rich and useful in many cirumstances, but it is not being widely used. There are many
reasons for this, the somewhat unmanageable amount of data being one of them, the difficulty of accessing and standardizing
the in principle freely available datasets is another.</p>

<p>Census data is inherently geographic in nature, working with the data without proper visualization tools can be challenging
too. And even for people that have good access to the data and that are well-versed in mapping geographic data, it can
still take quite a bit of time to generate maps visualizing the data. CensusMapper greatly speeds up this process by
allowing straightforward mapping of any function derived from census variables through all geographic aggregation levels
Canada wide.</p>

<h3>Storytelling</h3>

<p>Census mapper does more than just mapping census data. It is designed as a storytelling tool. Few maps are so crisp and
clear that they are self-explanatory. A map of population density might fall into that category. But most census variables
are sufficiently complex that maps derived from them warrant narration. We think of CensusMapper as a storytelling tool
that allows &lsquo;readers&rsquo; of the map to interact with it, zoom in, zoom out, pan around, and jump to other maps linked in the
story provided by the mapmaker.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<p>There are many ways to expand on this. On the map creation side we can offer more diverse coloring tools, allowing user
input and user defined map locations to be used in the mapping function, add data from previous census. We could allow
limited upload of user data to be integrated with census data, statistical and spacial analysis tools, custom mapping projects.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-25T23:18:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/08/25/the-hidden-mortgage</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some months ago I did a little side project and put some Census Canada data for Vancouver
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/census">on an interactive map</a> online. After it generated quite some interest, to a large part
due to Ian Young&rsquo;s reporting
<a href="http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1851003/bizarro-vancouver-25000-households-declare-less-income-they-spend">utilizing some of the data in the South China Morning Post</a>,
I talked to my friend Alejandro and we decided to set up a Census Mapper that allowes laymen to map any census variables
of their choosing Canada wide.</p>

<p>Since this is only a side project, it will take some time to set this up properly. In the meantime, I get to have some
fun to play with census data and map some variables of my choosing.</p>

<p>For a sneak preview of what the Census Mapper will be able to do read below the fold. No interaction, no chosing your
own variables and panning around Canada yet. Just some screenshots with a story to tie them together.</p>

<h3>Census Mapper Sneak Preview</h3>

<p>One of my many pet pieves has been the Drive Until You Qualify phrase. The idea is that you buy the house closest to your
place of work for which the bank will aprrove a loan. The obvious problem with this is that your commuting costs will
go up the further away from work you live &ndash; and you disposable income goes down accordingly. But the bank does not
seem to be bothered by that at all and often does not get much attention by househunting families either.</p>

<p>The fix? Easy. The cost of commuting and housing should not be separated by viewed in concert with one another.
People househunting right will have to do this based on their individual parameters, but let&rsquo;s take a look at what
choices people have made in the past based on Census Canada&rsquo;s 2011 NHS data.</p>

<h4>Dwelling Value</h4>

<p>In mapping terms, let&rsquo;s start with the map of Median Dwelling Values around Vancouver, taken from the NHS. Although
a little dated, it still serves to make the basic point.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dwelling_value.jpg" alt="&quot;Median Dwelling Value&quot;" /></p>

<p>The image is the familiar one, homes are expensive on the west side, a little less so toward the east. In Vancouver
proper the downtown area is somewhat affordable with prices dipping below $300,000 for the median dwelling. We are
considering the whole range, one bedroom condos all the way up to single family homes.</p>

<h4>Commute Time</h4>

<p>Next up, how much time to these people spend commuting? The NHS got you covered.</p>

<p><img src="/images/commute_time.jpg" alt="&quot;Median One Way Commute Time&quot;" /></p>

<p>The median one-way commute time give us a picture of how much time people spend to go to work. And we will assume they
spend the same time coming back.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to commute. We will think of the commute cost as being made up of two components. The money
spent to get to and from work and the dollar value of the time. That leaves us with two more questions. How much money
do people spent and how much is their time worth.</p>

<h4>Transportation Cost</h4>

<p>Luckily, again the NHS has something to say about this. To figure out the money spent on the commute we look at the mode
of transport. NHS tell us how many people drive, are passengers, take transit, cycle or walk to work. To keep things
simple we will compute the &lsquo;median commute cost&rsquo; by setting transit cost at $120 per month (roughly the price for a
2-zone transit pass) and for driving we set the car2go rate of 41c/min (which is quite generous, most people will spent
more if they own a car, and pay for gas, insurance, parking themselves and spent time to maintain it). For simplicit we
set the cost for passengers, cyclists and pedestrians at zero. So we sum over the number of drivers and transit users
and divide by the total number of commuters in each dissemination area to estimate that cost. Generally speaking it
turns out to be much smaller than the &lsquo;time cost&rsquo; calculated next.</p>

<h4>Time Cost</h4>

<p>To compute the &lsquo;time cost&rsquo; of commuting for the average person in each dissemination area we need to know what people&rsquo;s
time is worth. The NHS has a simple answer for that, the Median After Tax Household Income.</p>

<p><img src="/images/median_after_tax_income.jpg" alt="&quot;Median After Tax Household Income&quot;" /></p>

<p>We estimate the median annual time cost of the commute by taking the ratio of the daily commute time to the daily work time,
assumed to be eight hours, and multiplying it by the annual after tax income. That&rsquo;s more or less the money the average
person in that dissemination area makes in the time the person spent commuting. If there are several people in the
household contributing to the income, there will be several people spending time
commuting, so that effect roughly cancels out.</p>

<h4>Annual Commute Cost</h4>

<p>Putting it together we get the annual cost of the commute map.</p>

<p><img src="/images/commute_cost.jpg" alt="&quot;Annual Cost of Commute&quot;" /></p>

<p>This is only an estimate. From a technical perspective we probably should have been working with averages instead of
median values, but the result is very similar. Translating between time and money is inherintly tricky, most people can&rsquo;t
easily scale up or down the time they spent working to translate time into money. The easiest way to think of this is
someone who tries to work less hours (and get less pay) in order to spend more time with their family. One way to do
exactly that is to cut down on commute time.</p>

<h4>The Hidden Mortgage</h4>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to tie this back up with the price for housing. After all, the time you spent on your commute and your
mode choice for that commute, are intimately tied to where you choose to live. How do we combine the commute cost with
the housing cost?
As a rule of thumb, one makes $400 monthly payments for each $100,000 of mortgage. Give or take, but our numbers are
quite rough anyway. So taking the annual commute cost, dividing by 400 and multiplying by 100,000 we get the &lsquo;commute
cost mortgage equivalent&rsquo;. If we map it it looks the same as the previous map, just with different labels. But since I
like maps, here it is.</p>

<p><img src="/images/commute_mortgage_equivalent.jpg" alt="&quot;Commute Mortgage Equivalent&quot;" /></p>

<p>In other words, we translated the commute cost into &lsquo;hidden mortgage&rsquo; payments. Except, unlike a real mortgage, paying
it off does not generate any value for you.</p>

<h4>Combined Dwelling Value and Commute Cost</h4>

<p>Finally we have all we need for the end result. The Combined Dwelling Value and Commute Time/Mode Value Map where we
simply add the estimated commute mortgage cost onto the dwelling value.</p>

<p><img src="/images/combined_dwelling_commute.jpg" alt="&quot;Combined Dwelling Value And Commute Cost&quot;" /></p>

<p>It does not look radically different from the dwelling value map. It&rsquo;s almost the same around downtown where commute
time tends to be low and more expensive further out, where the &lsquo;hidden mortgage&rsquo; of commute time can add up to half a
million dollars.</p>

<p>Using Census Data can only help illustrate the hidden mortgage that people are already paying. It can only highlight
some general trends and ideas, it cannot make any statement about particular individual households, nor can the genral
reasoning used to derive the numbers apply to everyone. Or maybe even most people. The estimates are quite rough, likely
underestimating commute costs for drivers, not taking into account the well understood health benefits of active
transportation nor the negative health implications of driving. The commute time to money computation is very rough
and will have to be adjusted if applied to real-world examples. But this is only meant to illustrate ageneral point.</p>

<p>The takeaway should be that the &lsquo;hidden mortgage&rsquo; is real, and it&rsquo;s huge. And often overlooked.</p>
