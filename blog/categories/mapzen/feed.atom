    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I started thinking about <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/05/31/density-in-vancouver/">tax density</a>,
the amount of property taxes collected per area, I always felt that the data presentation in the map fell short.</p>

<p>Property taxes are somewhat insulated from the ups and downs of the real estate market as they are need-based and the mill
rate changes to flatten out the crazyness of the market. But what they lack in interesting patterns over time they more than
makes up for in interesting patterns in space.</p>

<p>To recognize these spacial patterns, one needs to switch layers in my
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.2741&amp;lng=-123.1321&amp;layer=10">assessment maps</a> and that&rsquo;s
a little awkward and most people won&rsquo;t do this.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember where I first saw some 3D data visualization around something like this, maybe in
<a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/11/18/mapping-the-effects-of-parking-minimums">this excellent Strong Towns post</a> that
explores tax density and parking.
When I was chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/dnproulx">Darren Proulx</a> about this I realized this is the perfect case
to rev up <a href="https://mapzen.com">Mapzen&rsquo;s awesone 3D map engine</a> for data visualization. Previously I had tried out the 3D
mapping capabilities to map
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/vancouver_lidar/map">the physical form of Vancouver&rsquo;s buildings obtained from LIDAR data</a>,
now it was time to map abstract data in 3D.</p>

<h3>3D Tax Density Maps</h3>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=14&lat=49.2814&lng=-123.1312" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/tax_density.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
The spacial patterns of tax density are closely related to zoning, so the obvious thing to do is to map both at the same
time. Tax density as the height and the zoning as the colour. But the relation between tax density and zoning is indirect,
it is given through land use. So when I
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/31/land-use/">folded the Metro Vancouver land use dataset into the asessment data</a>
I added another option to colour the map by land use. And the visualization works pretty well to show the relationship
between the variables.
Check out the <a class='btn' href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=14&lat=49.2814&lng=-123.1312" target="_blank">interactive map</a>.</p>

<h3>Some Quick Observations</h3>

<p>When comparing this to the <a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/11/18/mapping-the-effects-of-parking-minimums">Strong Towns post</a>
mentioned above it is interesting to note that the &ldquo;tax contribution of bare pavement&rdquo; is actually quite high relative to
many other commercial properties. For example, the giant parking lot around Safeway on 10th near UBC can&rsquo;t be discerned
from the map. Similarly, Oakridge Mall does not stand out as a low tax area. That&rsquo;s basically because in today&rsquo;s property
market the value of the property is dictated by the land value and few properties, even few commercial properties outside
of downtown, have building values in the same order of magnitude as the land value.</p>

<p>And that keeps the pressure on to redevelop the low building value commercial stock, typically replacing it with mixed use.
One example is the Safeway on Granville and 70th, that went from parking lot to mixed use. The high land values make this
kind of redevelopment attractive. Typically this redevelopment process will raise commercial rents, lower commercial
property taxes, add housing supply and increase tax density.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=16&lat=49.2433&lng=-123.151" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/triangle.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Another interesting area is the
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=16&lat=49.2433&lng=-123.151" target="_blank">condo/apartment triangle at Arbutus and 33rd</a>.
These condos/apartments abut Quilchena Park, have a grocery store in proximity but otherwise sit in a see of single family housing.
I would like to highlight two alternative development models. One is the single family housing that surrounds this area,
the other is one where one takes the condo/apartment complex and throws in the adjacent Quilchena Park. The park does not
house any people and does not generate tax revenue but provides great recreational value. Overall, the tax density, that is the
amount of taxes collected per area, of those two models are the same. So the condo complex together with the entire park
collects the same amount of taxes per area as single family housing. On the other hand, the condo complex plus park houses
3 to 4 times as many people per (combined) area as the surrounding single family housing.</p>

<p>Presenting these as alternative
development models one can ask how many people would prefer condo (and one dedicated rental building) plus park over
single family housing without park.
Condo values range between $448k to $2.6m with median of $745k. 56% of all units have 2 bedrooms, 9% with 3 bedrooms.
The surrounding single family housing start at
around $2.5m for a teardown. My guess is that there are more people interested in the condo plus park model than the
current Vancouver market offers.</p>

<h3>More Detailed Analysis</h3>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s take the tax density information and measure it against city services rendered. In other words, let&rsquo;s see who
pays their &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; of property taxes. Well, that&rsquo;s where I ran out of juice. There is lots of
work involved to do it right, too much to fit into my evening side project time budget.</p>

<p>Some have done some
<a href="http://mapstoryblog.thenittygritty.org/costofstreets/">really amazing work</a> trying to understand the give and take of
property taxes and services rendered, to the bar is pretty high.</p>

<p>Vancouver&rsquo;s situation, with the commercial property tax 5x the residential rate, has it&rsquo;s own quirks to add to the
complexity.</p>

<p>If someone is interested in spending the time to sieve through the city budget and process the data I would be happy to help out
with graphing and mapping. As long as the data is clean enough that it stays under my &ldquo;one evening side project time budget&rdquo;. :-)</p>

<h3>Looking Forward</h3>

<p>General public awareness about taxes, zoning and fairness seem to be rising. Recently a
<a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/02/8540903/lawsuit-claims-discrimination-real-estate-taxes">class action alleging discrimination in New York&rsquo;s property tax code</a>
was launched. An interesting precedent, and it will be interesting to watch the outcome.
And to see how this could apply to the tax and services balance
of low density vs high density. Or exclusionary zoning policies as the motor of unequal tax density.
Or minimum parking requirements which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/03/03/how-parking-requirements-hurt-the-poor/">disproportionally hurt poor people</a>.</p>

<p>As this kind of data becomes more publicly accessible and better visualizations make this complex issue more
accessible I expect these kind of questions to gain more traction.</p>

<h5>I can&rsquo;t view the 3D map!</h5>

<p>Sorry. Welcome to the world of modern web technology. (WebGL in this case.) If you try to look at the interactive map and don&rsquo;t see anything like the image above, then that&rsquo;s probably because
you either have and old (windows?) computer and/or an old (Internet Explorer) browser. If switching to Chrome or Firefox does
not fix this for you your best option is to cramp that map into your phone screen. Your phone is probably newer and supports
modern web technology much better than your computer. Or you can always view the 2D maps linked above.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/15/bike-data/"/>
    <updated>2015-12-15T15:16:48-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/15/bike-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/bike_map2.html"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/bike-routes2.png" style="width:25%;float:right"></a>Maps live and die with the quality
of the underlying data. So I decided to dive a little deeper down the OSM bike data rabbit hole. Task number one was
to expand display data for a wider region. My primitive workflow to pull data out of OSM only allows for extracting a quarter
of a degree at a time. For playing around with all of Vancouver&rsquo;s data I again turned to Mapzen for their
<a href="https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts">metro extracts</a> as a convenient shortcut for OSM data. For the case of Vancouver
the word &ldquo;metro&rdquo; is a bit of an exaggeration, it just covers the City of Vancouver. But good enough for some more testing.</p>

<h4>More data</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>More data means a a larger variety of <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:cycleway">bike infrastructure types</a>.
At first glance tagging seems to be reasonably accurate, but on closer inspection one quickly spots lots of issues.
First off, the <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwarrior/status/675820327331479552">edits Alex made earlier</a> are <strike>not
showing up, that&rsquo;s because the metro extracts are only done weekly. Just a matter of time.</strike> showing up now after
updating with new OSM data.</p>

<p>And then there are lots of little issues. Off street paths
don&rsquo;t connect to roads (or anything for that matter), making the useless for routing. Some changes in the bike network
are tagged differently, take Point Grey Road as an example. Some paths are labeled to be ok for bikes, but bikes aren&rsquo;t
allowed there. Some tags seem off.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t seem to have captured all relevant bike infrastructure, will have to spend some time one of these days to check
through all the different taggings in OSM to make sure I pull out all the correct ones.</p>

<p>So to make more sense out of the network I made a new map, added some more categories for optionally fading them out when
displayed. And on hover I display the tags, just for interest.</p>

<h4>Improving data</h4>

<p>This gets us to task number two. The folks at Mapzen gave me some friendly pointers to allow easy editing of features.
So I pasted a couple of lines of code in so if you hold down the shift key and
click on a feature, it will take you automatically to OSM to edit the feature. You may have to sign in the first time
you do this. If you hold the shift key while clicking anywhere else it also takes you to the OSM editor for that spot,
in case you want to add something there. It takes a lot of the pain out of editing bike infrastructure, I just fixed a
whole bunch of things in short time.</p>

<iframe src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_map2.html" width="100%" height="550"></iframe>


<p>Go for it and fix some problems that you see, either by shift-clicking on the embedded map or by
<a href="/bike_map2.html">taking the map full-screen first</a>. Remember that some of the issues may be fixed already, the bike map will not reflect
updates until a week later or so.</p>

<h4>Where to go from here?</h4>

<p>It looks like making a decent bike map with OSM data is feasible. The hard work will be to collaboratively do all the
OSM edits required to get the data into good shape.</p>

<p>One problem is that edits won&rsquo;t show up on the bike map for up to a week, that&rsquo;s the frequency at which the metro extracts
are updated. And then I have to update the file for displaying the bike data. A minor inconvenience, in theory there
are ways to seed this up if one wants to be serious about this. But then again, once the OSM bike data is fixed up in a
given region, it won&rsquo;t need updating very frequently.</p>

<p>I guess I will have to mull this over and decide how deep down this rabbit hole I would like to go. Looking back at my
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/13/how-to-make-a-bike-map/">rant on what&rsquo;s wrong with most bike maps</a> I am
asking myself how much the current map has accomplished.</p>

<ol>
<li>The accuracy of the infrastructure mapped is in the hands of the OSM community. With easy access to the OSM editing
functionality from the map (desktop only) it&rsquo;s in the hands of the people that know best: cyclists.</li>
<li>Still coming up blank when it comes to showing comfort level. Will have to think more how to best do this, it might
have to go into a separate database. Which is doable, but requires work to get it right and is probably a little too
involved to do it off the side.</li>
<li>Click and zoom is not an issue, but now I am in the opposite corner where it might be nice sometimes to actually have
a glossy big paper map. And it&rsquo;s really easy to save the map as an image. Some tinkering should be able to produce a nice
high-resolution one covering a large area.</li>
<li>The map already adapts to user preferences quite well, different types of infrastructure will fade out if deselected.</li>
<li>Not on the original list, but routing should be part of this. Routing works reasonably well to get this off the ground,
but work is still required to make it work properly with user preferences. This may well require running a custom router,
again a little more than I bargained for.</li>
</ol>


<p>So is this really worth the trouble to make yet another bike map? I am not sure. It&rsquo;s always easy to through up a quick
proof of concept, but to do it really well requires quite a bit more work. For now I could just build one focused on
Vancouver and see how it goes. And it would be great if the comfort level rating could somehow be automated.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/cycletrack.PNG" style="width:50%;float:right">Which brings to another one of pet projects that
I never took beyond the testing realm. My CycleTrack App that records
all bike trips in the background (as long as you carry your phone with you). No pressing of &ldquo;start&rdquo; or &ldquo;stop&rdquo; buttons,
the app notices when you are moving and will take gyroscope and accelerometer readings to figure out if you are cycling,
running, walking, driving or taking a train. Then it stores your cycling trips and computes aggregate data. It avoids
using GPS so not to drain your battery too much, on a typical day it will consume about 3% of battery power. The downside
is that the accuracy and frequency of the location updates is not as high, so things get a little messy. But not too bad.</p>

<p>How does this fit into the bike map project? Simple. If one can collect regular cycling data from normal people
cycling (not just
the lycra crowd that presses start cycles in circles and presses stop again and recharges their phone while taking a shower),
once can infer a lot about comfort levels just by looking at the data. And to collect data from regular &ldquo;citizen cyclist&rdquo;
one cannot expect them to press &ldquo;start&rdquo; and &ldquo;stop&rdquo; to delineate their bike trips, and one cannot have an app that will
require them to recharge their phone after every trip.</p>

<p>But then the project gets even bigger&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/bike_routing.html"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/routing.png" style="width:25%;float:right"></a>Routing is a hard problem. Routing for drivers is pretty good at this point, mostly because we have been very good at
designing for cars and creating predicable infrastructure. Routing for bikes is a whole other story, data quality is
poor and the physical infrastructure is, at least in North America, not strongly predictive of cycling comfort/safety.
And cycling comfort/safety is the top priority for the
<a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/03/13/the-first-ever-nationwide-survey-of-interested-but-concerned-bikers-is-here/">vast majority of (potential) cyclists</a>.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s the ones that don&rsquo;t cycle frequently, often out of concern for safety, that would benefit most from effective
bike routing.</p>

<p>Read on or <a href="/bike_routing.html">go directly to the routing demo</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Google does a decent job directing a relatively experienced cyclist from A to B, but it has a hard time to learn about
places where cyclists can go but cars can&rsquo;t. And it won&rsquo;t be able to answer my fundamental question: <em>Can I bring my 6
year old along?</em>. And Apple doesn&rsquo;t even try and offer bike routing.</p>

<h4>Routing test</h4>

<p>So what&rsquo;s really needed apart from <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/13/how-to-make-a-bike-map/">better bike maps</a>
is better bike routing. So building on yesterday&rsquo;s post, I decided to take a quick look at routing. Time to try out
<a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/valhalla">Mapzen&rsquo;s routing engine</a> which, as expected, was really easy to set up:</p>

<p>Feel free to drag the endpoints to test your favorite routes.</p>

<iframe src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_routing.html" width="100%" height="550"></iframe>


<p><a href="/bike_routing.html">Full screen view</a></p>

<p>Initial testing seems to indicate that this works reasonably well. And while the engine allows for some customization
on rider needs, right now there is no way to get the &ldquo;dad&rsquo;s routing&rdquo; that I would like to have.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is of course that I still don&rsquo;t have enough information in OSM to even make a &ldquo;dad&rsquo;s map&rdquo;
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/13/how-to-make-a-bike-map/">as I lamented earlier</a>. But at least OSM gets
me half-way there by giving me a finer control over distinguishing infrastructure that I may deem as generally more
suitable so that I can fade selected bike infrastructure out by checking the appropriate boxes in the map.</p>

<h4>Route costing options</h4>

<p>The bike routing options in Mapzen&rsquo;s routing engine allow for some level of control on wheter gravel should be avoided
(great feature for the lycra cowed but useless for dads), whether hill should be avoided (helpful) and whether to avoid
roads without bike infrastructure. But when I cycle with my 6 year old a bike lane between parked cars and 50 traffic
is as good as no bike infrastructure at all. And there is currently no way to cost different types of bike
infrastructure, so they can&rsquo;t be used as a proxy for cycling comfort.</p>

<h4>Where to go from here</h4>

<p>Next steps are to <a href="https://github.com/valhalla/thor">look deeper into Mapzen&rsquo;s routing engine</a> and see how hard it would
be to hack some of these more advanced costing options into their routing engine and open up a feature request.</p>

<p>Wrapping up the three-night trials in bike mapping is the
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/15/bike-data/">post on data</a>.</p>

forget and maybe to start a discussion.</p>

<p>Bike enthusiasts, OSM folks and mapping technology wonks read on!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>Why make a new bike map?</h4>

<p>Plainly put, I don&rsquo;t like a lot of the bike maps out there. Time for my little bike map rant:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lots of maps don&rsquo;t accomplish their core mission:
accurately map bike infrastructure. For example, when in real life a bike lane vanishes 100m in front of an intersection
and reappears 100m after the intersection, leaving cyclists exposed right where protection is needed the most, most
bike maps will mark the entire section as having a bike lane.</li>
<li>Most bike maps focus on the wrong issue. They focus on physical infrastructure, as a cyclist I am interested in
cycling comfort level. Can I take my 6 year old along that route? Can I cycle leisurely or will I feel hastened by a
car breathing down my neck? Will I arrive at my destination relaxed or will I be riled up by 3 near misses and 5 drivers
swearing at me? Some of these questions can be answered by mapping infrastructure. A physically separated bike path will
give me the comfort I need to bing my 6 year old and enjoy my ride. But when it comes to &ldquo;bike lane&rdquo; or &ldquo;shared road&rdquo;
designations, I have no idea what it will feel like until I get there.</li>
<li>Most bike maps have not yet made the transition from paper/PDF based maps to clickable and zoomable maps that can be
easily consumed on the go.</li>
<li>Most maps are static, they don&rsquo;t adapt to the needs of the user. Why do I have to deal with 5 different colors and
3 types of shading when reading a bike map, when all I want to know is if I can bring my 6 year old along for the ride.
I want an &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; button that fades out all routes that are not suitable for all ages and abilities. For that purpose I
don&rsquo;t care if a road has infrastructure like a bike lane wedged between parked cars and 50km/h traffic. If we absolutely
have to ride that way it will be on the sidewalk.</li>
</ol>


<h4>How to make a new bike map?</h4>

<p>First let&rsquo;s start with examples of how other have tried to solve these problems. Probably one of the best maps out there
is the <a href="https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/crd-document-library/maps/transportation/bikemap2014-frontback-web.pdf?sfvrsn=8">Capital Regional District Bike Map</a>.
I chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/Burgundavia">Corey</a> who worked for CRD on these maps on how it was done. They collected all the bike infrastructure
in the region by contacting all the municipalities. <img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/victoria.png" style="width:50%;float:left"> Then they meticulously
checked that what the municipalities reported actually existed on the ground.  Consider Fort road on their bike map where they accurately show the bike lane
cutting out. And they added in shortcuts and connections
that the municipalities did not report on, like a short section of footway that may technically require walking the bike
but shortcuts out of a suburban cul-de-sac maze.</p>

<p>Next the CRD map does not only map infrastructure, but color-codes it to show cycling comfort. <img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/victoria-legend.png" style="width:50%;float:right">
This gives me a good idea how comfortable the rider will feel. Unfortunately all that complexity starts to make it difficult to
read the bike map.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where technology could come to the rescure. The CRD map is a PDF map and suffers the usual limitations that come
with it. The map cannot adapt to the needs of the reader. So how about moving the map online and letting the user decide
how to display it?</p>

<h4>Bike maps that adapt to the user</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/01/bleak-maps-of-how-cities-look-using-only-their-bike-lanes/">Washington Post Wonkblog</a>
had an excellent feature mapping only the bike infrastructure, nothing else. And for good measure, they removed the
shared streets bike infrastructure. The rational was that in most cases, comfort level on shared street bike routes is really no different from
cycling on a parallel road. Inspired by that I decided <a href="/blog/2015/04/01/bike-paths/">map Vancouver and a couple of other cities</a>
and I added in some button to allow selectively turning on or off typed of infrastructure.</p>

<iframe src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths.html?fh=50&nh=true" width="50%" height="300" style="float:left;"></iframe>


<p>That&rsquo;s getting one step closer to adaptable bike maps, but it is still missing the main point that as a cyclist I am
most interested in comfort level, and infrastructure type is only a proxy for that. And a poor one in many cases.</p>

<h4>Inspiration</h4>

<p>Not convinced we need a new bike map? Let&rsquo;s draw on some local (for me) maps that inspired this effort.</p>

<p>UBC Campus Planning <a href="https://twitter.com/ubc_candcp/status/662027568204357633">keeps tweeting out a bike map</a>
that lists several dangerous roads as &ldquo;designated on street cycling routes&rdquo;, including an unlit divided 4 lane highway
with a posted speed limit of 60km/h and typical traffic speeds significantly exceeding that. And all of that apparently
aimed at people that don&rsquo;t cycle to campus yet but are considering doing so.</p>

<p>TransLink just <a href="http://www.translink.ca/-/media/Documents/cycling/cycling_routes/full_maps/TransLink%20Regional%20Cycling%20Map%20West.pdf">updated their bike map</a>
and marks said highway as &ldquo;recommended by cyclists&rdquo;. The do acknowlege that the road &ldquo;does not have special treatment
for cyclists&rdquo;. So why include it on the map? Filling in the the gaps in the cycling network should happen in real life,
not just on the map.</p>

<p>Even HUB keeps <a href="https://bikehub.ca/about-us/our-positions/ungapthemap">marking Wesbrook Mall north of Agronomy as &ldquo;existing cycling route&rdquo;</a>
when in real life it is everything but that.</p>

<h4>How to make a bike map</h4>

<p>So how should we make a bike map? I was always thinking about setting up my own database and somehow adding and rating
infrastructure. Then <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwarrior">Alex</a> decided to start making a bike
map for the UBC area. And he chose the most straight-forward path: Editing Open Street Map data. That way the edits are
immediately (better: after their map tile refresh cycle) available online, for example on
<a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/">OpenCycleMaps</a>. The map is easily accessible
on the go, it zooms and scrolls. It is missing a &lsquo;locate me&rsquo; button (which is easy to fix). The look and feel is a little
dated. But most importantly, it does not adapt to the user&rsquo;s needs. I can&rsquo;t ask it to display the &ldquo;dad&rsquo;s version&rdquo; of the
cycle network, showing me only pieces that I will be comfortable cycling with my 6 year old.</p>

<p>Technology has moved along since that map was built. A very easy way to solve these issues is to
utilized the awesome tools built by the folks at <a href="https://mapzen.com">Mapzen</a>. Their
<a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram">tangram mapping engine</a> taps into their
<a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles">OSM vector tile service</a> to make flexible mapping of bike data a breeze. And
to top things off, they offer very easy to use and extremely powerful ways to style the map. Only problem: Mapzen&rsquo;s
OSM extracts don&rsquo;t have cycling information. Not a big problem though, we can just pull them out separately and add
them on by hand. Here is an example where only the bike routes near UBC are added.</p>

<p>One small drawback is that WebGL, the technology Tangram is based on, is not available for much of the windows world.
WebGL requires modern browsers (IE9 does not count) and also modern hardware/graphics card drivers. A couple of years
old windows machine will likely not be able to render WebGL no matter what browser you use. But the main target is
mobile, and iOS and most android won&rsquo;t have a problem with WebGL. If really needed, could add a fallback or use older
and web technology to make the map, but Mapzen&rsquo;s Tangram makes it so ridiculously easy to make and style nice maps&hellip;</p>

<h4>The main problem left to solve</h4>

<p>One major problem left. OSM does not have and &ldquo;cycling comfort&rdquo; tags right now. There are tags for physical infrastructure,
and in some cases the comfort level can be correctly inferred from those. But in many cases it can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>There are two ways around that. One could
keep those tags in a separate file, but that becomes difficult to maintain when OSM features change. Or one can add the
tag to the OSM data. That way better bike maps can scale easily, and the information can also be used in OSM-based
routing services where their real value lies.</p>

<p>Not sure which is the way to go here, a similar tag
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/bike_safety">has been proposed before</a> but apparently did not
go anywhere. Looking at the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Any_tags_you_like">tag guidelines</a> the fact they these
new tags are very useful for routing seems to speak for adding them to OSM, but the fact that they are measuring
something explicitly non-geographic by going beyond the already existing physical infrastructure markers might mean
they are better kept in an external database. Will have to think this over, feedback appreciated.</p>

<h4>Where to go from here.</h4>

<p>The logical next step is to add routing. Again, Mapzen&rsquo;s <a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/valhalla/">flexible routing service</a>
seems to be a natural match. Also, adding editing capabilities right onto the map would be quite useful. The bike map is
where data issues are best seen, and saving the step to head over to OSM to fix it (after creating an account) and then
waiting for the data to update on the map seems like a workflow that will discourage wide participation.</p>
