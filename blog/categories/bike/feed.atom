    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Motivated by the excellent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/01/bleak-maps-of-how-cities-look-using-only-their-bike-lanes/">Washington Post Wonkblog</a> I
mapped Vancouver&rsquo;s bike infrastructure. Looks good at first, but when you take out the &lsquo;fake&rsquo; &ldquo;Local Street&rdquo; bikeways more in line with Wonkblog&rsquo;s methodology it&rsquo;s looking pretty
bleak in large portions of the city.</p>

<p>Of course the devil is in the details and infrastructure cannot just be judged by how it&rsquo;s labeled. If one were to look for 8-80 infrastructure, then the separated lanes
would make the cut. Some of the bike lanes would be marginal, but most would probably make the cut. Although I can&rsquo;t say that I would be particularly keen to let an 8yo cycle on
some of them.</p>

<p>Vancouver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shared Lanes&rdquo; are not for the faint of heart. They have 50 speed limits on multi-lane roadways
and feature sharrows to make it a little easier for cyclists to &lsquo;take the lane&rsquo;. In some cases cyclists share a lane with
the buses, which is a little better.</p>

<p>The local streets are mostly car tunnels like the &lsquo;Off-Broadway&rsquo; and won&rsquo;t qualify as 8-80, but there are some exceptions like
the local street portion of Pt. Grey Rd, where cycling is rather pleasant.</p>

<p>Methodology is simple, it&rsquo;s just the city&rsquo;s bike path data from <a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">their open data catalogue</a>. The data
comes with two fields, &lsquo;name&rsquo; and &lsquo;type&rsquo;. The &lsquo;type&rsquo; was used for the checkboxes at the bottom to selectively turn different
bike lane types on or off and the &lsquo;name&rsquo; will be displayed on hover.</p>
