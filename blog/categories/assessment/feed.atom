the ongoing debade on affordability of housing in the City of Vancouver we regularly hear voices expressing concern for
&ldquo;<a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrew-coyne-dont-blame-chinese-billionaires-for-vancouver-housing-prices">elderly folks of modest means who had been counting on using their home as a pension</a>&rdquo;
to argue against doing anything to ease the housing affordability problems many (younger) people are facing. In these
arguments the concern for &ldquo;elderly folks of modest means&rdquo; seems curiously focused to those who own property as opposed to,
for example, the 20% of the elderly people in Vancouver that live in poverty (15k total).</p>

<p>Which got me a little thinking about &ldquo;earning money&rdquo; in this day and age.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>Most people earn money by working. We are interested in after tax household income, for simplicity we will look at 2010 income
data reported in the 2011 census. The median after-tax household income in Vancouver
was $50k (the average was $65k), although there is <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/224">large regional variability</a>.
The pre-tax households incomes were $56k for the median
and $80k for the average income.</p>

<p>Incomes have grown a bit since then, median income levels in
Vancouver grew by 7% from 2010 to 2013 (<a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a47">the latest year Stats Canada reports on</a>)
and will have grown a little more since then, but these are relatively small changes compared to other numbers I want
to talk about.</p>

<p><a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/189">Most of this income stems from employment income</a> which also includes self-employment,
but 22% of pre-tax income in Vancouver
came from outher sources, mostly investment income but also government transfer payments like child benefits.</p>

<p>Cumulative, the after tax income put $17.8bn into Vancouverite&rsquo;s pockets.</p>

<h3>Twiddling Thumbs</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare this to how much Vancouver home owner households earned last year by twiddling thumbs. Let&rsquo;s do a simple
calculation and focus on RS (&ldquo;One Family Dwelling&rdquo; zone) homes. We
will consider the change in land value only, changing the building value because of renovation or rebuilding certainly
does not happen by twiddling thumbs. And we will divide the land value rise of each property by the number of owners,
for RS that evenly divides up the land value increase between strata or duplex households that managed to sneak into the RS zoning.</p>

<p>The typical RS household made $267,000 last year (so that&rsquo;s the median land value rise in RS between 2015 and 2016
property tax assessment years, the average was $331,043), for a tity toal of $28,789,790,980. Not too shabby.
And considering that the typical owner household
lives in their home, these are tax-free earnings once the owners sell. That&rsquo;s substantially more than what the typical household
in Vancouver takes home. The total land value increase for just the RS zone properties amounts to $22.2bn out of
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/17/updated-vancouver-assessment-data/">the $45.2bn by which land values in Vancouver increased overall</a>. For context,
recall that the overall income earned by all Vancouverites in 2010 was $17.8bn after tax (21.3bn before tax).</p>

<p>In other words, just the RS property owners earned more by twiddling their tumbs than the entire population of the
City of Vancouver did by &ndash; actually working. Yet another
indication of how <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/37">out of touch the property market is with the local enconomy</a>.</p>

<h3>Mappig the Result of Thumb Twiddling</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12">There is a map for this</a>. (I probably would not take the time to write about this otherwise.) Last year&rsquo;s assessment
increase was quite large, not every year is like this (although it looks like the coming one will also be substantial).
To even things out a little I mapped the average yearly gross land value increase for each property. And for good measure I, divided
by the number of households for strata, duplex and other properties that are tied to several owners. For properties that I
could not trace back all the way to 2006 I averaged over as many years as I could find.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs.png" style="width:50%;float:right;"></a>
<a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12">Looking at the map</a> we see that
the average yearly increase depends to a large extend on the square footage of the property. Large properties naturally stand
out, unless they are stratified where the land value increase gets distributed across all the owners.</p>

<p>Averaged over 10 years, the yearly land value increase for the typical RS property in Vancouver was $82,700. Using Main as
a divider the numbers are $66,600 for the
typical east of Main and $145,100 for the typical west of Main property (using median increases). The average increases were $117,334 city wide,
$73,294 east and $175,773 west of Main.</p>

<p>A good portion of the east-west difference is due to larger lot size, but even the land values increase per m&sup2; for properties
on the west side was 35% higher than that of properties on the
east side. These are yearly increases, to be accumulated and collected tax free in most cases when the property is sold.</p>

<h3>Hourly Rate for Twiddling Thumbs</h3>

<p>Just for fun we can work out the hourly rate for twiddling thumbs. All we need to do is divide by the number of work
hours by year. We can look up the average work weeks for a Vancouver worker in the 2011 census and, for style points also consider the
number of household maintainers. After all, when we compare household income with land value increases we should consider how many
people in the household work. 63% of Vancouver households have only one household maintainer, but
<a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/223">33% have two and 4% three or more household maintainers</a> contributing to household income.
On average a Vancouver household <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/222">worked a total of 62 person-weeks per year</a> to earn
that income. Assuming a 40 hour work week, we compute the average after-tax earning to be $26 per hour from regular work
and average after tax earnings of $113 per hour from twiddling thumbs. That&rsquo;s assuming all household maintainers are twiddling
the same amount of time that they dedicate to regular work. (In this calculation we use average not median income and land value
increases, medians don&rsquo;t lend themselves well to these kind of reasoning.)</p>

<p>Using the 10 year averaged numbers instead of focusing on just the last year we still get a healthy average after-tax twiddling thumbs rate of $47 per hour.</p>

<p>I am not entirely sure why anyone would want twiddling thumbs to stay so lucrative. Unless maybe the super self-centered thumb-twiddlers.
Or why earnings from thumb-twiddling should remain tax-free. While employment income is taxed (as it should be).</p>

<p>Considering to change your line work to thumb twiddling? To bad thumb twiddling is so unaffordable!</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/special/34?layer=12"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/RS_original.png" style="width:50%;float:right;"></a>
I got some good feedback on the post so I decided to clear some things up and re-run the analysis with some small changes.</p>

<p>Linking a map of all properties when the analysis was only done on RS properties was a little confusing. So I added a map
<a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/special/34?layer=12">of all RS zoned properties only</a> that the analysis was based on.</p>

<p>Some people correctly pointed out that there are some schools and other large properties that are RS zone but probably
should not be included in the analysis. So I decided to quickly re-run the analysis where I excluded properties with
area larger than 10,000m&amp;sup2. The cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, but it seemed about right so that schools and other large
properties are excluded, but most large single family lots are still included. The filter is not perfect, but probably
better than running the analysis without the filter. Here is the raw output with the area cutoff:</p>

<h5>Land Value Rise in RS (2015 - 2016)</h5>

<ul>
<li>City Wide: Average $318,877 Median $267,000, Count: 67269, Total: $21,450,566,401, Hourly: $128</li>
<li>East of Main: Average $235,871 Median $231,000, Count: 38319, Total: $9,038,373,901, Hourly: $95</li>
<li>West of Main: Average $428,745 Median $381,000, Count: 28950, Total: $12,412,192,500, Hourly: $172</li>
</ul>


<p>As expected, the area cutoff had almost no effect on the median, but did push the average down a bit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/special/37?layer=12"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/RS.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
The map shows the average increases over a 10 year timeframe, here are the numbers with the <a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/special/37?layer=12">larger properties exluded</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>City Wide: Average $112,588 Median $82,500, Count: 66556, Total: $7,493,456,449, Hourly: $45</li>
<li>East of Main: Average $70,109 Median $66,600, Count: 37960, Total: $2,661,346,243, Hourly: $28</li>
<li>West of Main: Average $168,978 Median $145,100, Count: 28596, Total: $4,832,110,206, Hourly: $68</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, I decided to do another run of the analysis including RT and RM zones (Two and Multiple Family Dwelling) next to RS (One Family Dwelling),
as well as Shaugnessy&rsquo;s FSD zone. Things get a little tricky in RT and RM. There are many single family properties in these
zones, so for those things work as expected. Then there are stratified properties, and we divide by the number of owners
to split up the land value rise. And there are larger rental buildings where the owner takes the entire land value increase.</p>

<p>Here is the raw output of the analysis:</p>

<h5>Land Value Rise in RS, RT, RM and FSD (2015 - 2016)</h5>

<ul>
<li>City Wide: Average $336,504 Median $265,000, Count: $84683, Total: $28,496,185,854, Hourly: $135</li>
<li>East of Main: Average $239,916 Median $230,000, Count: $47893, Total: $11,490,308,602, Hourly: $96</li>
<li>West of Main: Average $462,241 Median $375,000, Count: $36790, Total: $17,005,877,252, Hourly: $186</li>
</ul>


<p>To round things up, here are the numbers for RS, RT, RM and FSD zones averaged over 10 years:</p>

<h5>Land Value Rise in RS, RT, RM and FSD (2006 - 2016)</h5>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/special/36?layer=12"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/RS+RT+RM+FSD.png" style="width:50%;float:right;"></a></p>

<p>City Wide: Average $119,596 Median $83,000, Count: 83479, Total: $9,983,800,611, Hourly: $48
East of Main: Average $72,767 Median $67,200, Count: 47254, Total: $3,438,565,286, Hourly: $29
West of Main: Average $180,682 Median $143,600, Count: 36225, Total: $6,545,235,325, Hourly: $72</p>

<p>And for good measure, <a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/special/36?layer=12">here is the map for the properties included in the last analysis</a>.</p>

<h2>Later update</h2>

<p>After importing the <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/31/land-use/">Metro Vancouver land use data</a> we can
now pinpoint all Single Familiy Dwellings and don&rsquo;t have to use zoning as a proxy. Here are the numbers when running them
only on all of City of Vancouver&rsquo;s 78,740 Single Family Dwellings:</p>

<h5>SFH Land Value Rise (2015 - 2016)</h5>

<ul>
<li>City Wide: Average $313,072 Median $262,000, Count: 78740, Total: $24,651,312,001, Hourly: $126</li>
<li>East of Main: Average $230,106 Median $230,000, Count: 46014, Total: $10,588,122,001, Hourly: $92</li>
<li>West of Main: Average $429,725 Median $375,000, Count: 32726, Total: $14,063,190,000, Hourly: $173</li>
</ul>


<h5>SFH Land Value Rise (2006 - 2016)</h5>

<ul>
<li>City Wide: Average $109,969 Median $79,800, Count: 77981, Total: $8,575,547,711, Hourly: $44</li>
<li>East of Main: Average $68,656 Median $66,700, Count: 45647, Total: $3,133,947,703, Hourly: $27</li>
<li>West of Main: Average $168,293 Median $141,700, Count: 32334, Total: $5,441,600,008, Hourly: $67</li>
</ul>


<p>The total number of units for the 2006 to 2016 analysis are a little lower since not all properties can be traced over that time
period without resorting to more tedious analysis.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=sfh&amp;layer=12">here is the obligatory map for the properties included in the last analysis</a>.</p>
