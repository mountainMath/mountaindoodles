the ongoing debade on affordability of housing in the City of Vancouver we regularly hear voices expressing concern for
&ldquo;<a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrew-coyne-dont-blame-chinese-billionaires-for-vancouver-housing-prices">elderly folks of modest means who had been counting on using their home as a pension</a>&rdquo;
to argue against doing anything to ease the housing affordability problems many (younger) people are facing. In these
arguments the concern for &ldquo;elderly folks of modest means&rdquo; seems curiously confined to those who own property, those who don&rsquo;t are left out
to fend for themselves, in particularly the 20% of the elderly people in Vancouver that live in poverty (15k total).</p>

<p>Which got me a little thinking about &ldquo;earning money&rdquo; in this day and age. And prompted me to make <a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12">a new map</a>.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>Most people earn money by working. We are interested in after tax household income, for simplicity we will look at 2010 income
data reported in the 2011 census. The median after-tax household income in Vancouver
was $50k (the average was $65k), although there is <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/224">large regional variability</a>.
The pre-tax incomes were $56k for the median
and $80k for the average income.</p>

<p>Depending on what we are interested in we could also focus in on families. Couple families with children took home an median income
of $82k ($102k average) after tax, lone parent family median income was $41k ($52k average).</p>

<p>Incomes have grown a bit since then, median income levels in
Vancouver grew by 7% from 2010 to 2013 (<a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a47">the latest year Stats Canada reports on</a>)
and will have grown a little more since then, but these are relatively small changes compared to other numbers I want
to talk about.</p>

<p><a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/189">Most of this income stems from employment income</a> which also includes self-employment,
but 22% of pre-tax income in Vancouver
came from outher sources, mostly investment income but also government transfer payments like child benefits.</p>

<p>Cumulative, the after tax income put $17.8bn into Vancouverite&rsquo;s pockets.</p>

<h3>Twiddling Thumbs</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare this to how much Vancouver home owner households earned last year by twiddling thumbs. Let&rsquo;s do a simple
calculation and focus on RS (&ldquo;One Family Dwelling&rdquo; zone) homes. We
will consider the change in land value only, changing the building value because of renovation or rebuilding certainly
does not happen by twiddling thumbs. And we will divide the land value rise of each property by the number of owners,
for RS that evenly divides up the land value increase between strata or duplex owners that managed to sneak into the RS zoning.</p>

<p>The typical RS household made $267,000 last year (so that&rsquo;s the median land value rise in RS between 2015 and 2016
property tax assessment years, the average was $331,043), for a tity toal of $28,789,790,980. Not too shabby.
And considering that the typical owner household
lives in their home, these are tax-free earnings once the owners sell. That about 5 times what the average household
in Vancouver takes home. The total land value increase for just the RS zone properties amounts to $22.2bn out of
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/17/updated-vancouver-assessment-data/">the $45.2bn by which land values in Vancouver increased overall</a>. For context,
recall that the overall income earned by all Vancouverites in 2010 was $17.8bn after tax (21.3bn before tax).</p>

<p>In other words, just the RS property owners earned more moeny by twiddling their tumbs than the entire population of the
City of Vancouver did by &ndash; actually working. Yet another
indication of how <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/37">out of touch the property market is with the local enconomy</a>.</p>

<h3>Mappig the Result of Thumb Twiddling</h3>

<p>I probably would not take the time to write about this otherwise. Last year&rsquo;s assessment
increase was quite large, not every year is like this (although it looks like the coming one will also be substantial). So
to even things out a little I mapped the average yearly gross land value increase for each property. And for good measure I, divided
by the number of owners for strata, duplex and other properties that are tied to several owners. For properties that I
could not trace back all the way to 2006 I averaged over as many years as I could find.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs.png" style="width:50%;float:right;"></a>And yes, <a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12">there is a map for this</a>.
<a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.253&amp;lng=-123.1244&amp;layer=12">Looking at the map</a> we see that
the average yearly increase depends to a large extend on the sqaure footage of the property. Large properties naturally stand
out, unless they are stratified where the land value increase gets distributed across all the owners.</p>

<p>Averaged over 10 years, the yearly land value increase for the typical RS property in Vancouver was $82,700, $66,600 for the
typical east of Main and $145,100 for the typical west of Main. The average increases were $117,334, $73,294 and $175,773, respectively.</p>

<p>A good portion of the east-west difference is due to larger lot size, but even the land values increase per m&sup2; for properties
on the west side was almost twice that of properties on the
east side. These are yearly increases, to be accumulated and collected tax free in most cases when the property is sold.</p>

<h3>Hourly Rate for Twiddling Thumbs</h3>

<p>Just for fun we can work out the hourly rate for twiddling thumbs. All we need to do is to divide by the number of work
hours by year. To estimate the work weeks we could get fancy and also consider the
number of household maintainers. After all, when we compare household income with land value increases we should consider how many
people in the household work. 63% of Vancouver households have only one household maintainer, but
<a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/223">33% have two and 4% three or more household maintainers</a> contributing to household income.
On average a Vancouver household <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/222">worked a total of 62 person-weeks per year</a> to earn
that income. Assuming a 40 hour work week, we compute the average after-tax earning to be $26 per hour from regular work
and average after tax earnings of $113 per hour from twiddling thumbs. That&rsquo;s assuming all household maintainers are twiddle
the same amount of time that they dedicate to regular work. (Here we use average not median income and land value
increases, medians don&rsquo;t lend themselves well to these kind of computations.)</p>

<p>The 10 year averaged numbers we still get a healthy average after-tax twiddling thumbs rate of $47 per hour.</p>

<p>I am not entirely sure why some people would like twiddling thumbs stay so lucrative and why earnings from thumb-twiddling
should remain tax-free.</p>
