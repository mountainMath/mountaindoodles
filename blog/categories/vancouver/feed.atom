    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/transit/map"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/transit_vancouver.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
I have played with <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/mobility/isochrone/api-reference/#isochrone-service-api-reference">Mapzen&rsquo;s Isochrone serivce</a>
in the past with a simple <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/11/18/interactive-isochrones/">visualization of walksheds</a>.</p>

<p>Recently Mazen <a href="https://mapzen.com/blog/exclusion/">updated the isochrone API</a> to allow for a more
fine-grained selection of exactly what transit services to include
or exclude in transit routing, and they created an <a href="https://mapzen.com/mobility/explorer/">amazing mobility explorer</a>
based on that.</p>

<p>Partially motivated by chatting with two TransLink planners I decided to riff off of that and
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/transit/map">take a look at how well TransLink serves different parts of Vancouver</a>.
At different times of day.
And how susceptible TransLink&rsquo;s network is
to Skytrain service disruptions.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To do this I decided to allow users to drag a location pin around that sets the start location, allow to change the time of day,
and call Mapzen&rsquo;s API to compute transit isochrones to visualize what areas can be reached
from the start location in 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.</p>

<p>To add some fun I made the Skytrain stations clickable, allowing the user to toggle the station status from open to closed,
so users can explore how mobility options change if a station is closed for boarding and no Skytrains pass through
any more. Essentially this cuts the transit network.</p>

<p>This does neglect bottlenecks that will emerge when alternative routes become overcrowded in the event of a skytrain failure,
and it does not take into account countermeasures by TransLink to deploy parallel buses, but it nonetheless gives
interesting conclusions about how crucial certain nodes are to the overall network.</p>

<p>Do you feel that your area is not served well enough by transit? Or under served in the evenings? Or are you worried about
what happens if the Skytrain breaks down somewhere? Just
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/transit/map" target="_blank" class='btn btn-default'>launch the Vancouver Transit Explorer</a>
and play around to see how transit serves your needs.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t live in Vancouver and want to explore transit in your region? Not a problem. Use the search bar to jump to whatever city you
are interested in and click on the map to move the start location there. Then drag it around to explore that region.</p>

<p>If transit services in your city are already part of the <a href="https://transit.land/feed-registry/">TransitLand feed registry</a> that is.
If not, this visualization won&rsquo;t do you much good right now. If you are keen to use it to explore transit in your city,
just help TransitLand <a href="https://transit.land/news/2016/02/19/get-started-add-feeds.html">add your local transit agency to their feed registry</a>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>I used settings that assume we have some happy walkers that are willing to walk quite a bit to get to and from transit, as
well as walking between stations. It seemed to me that the visualization is already overloaded with options that I did not want
to throw in another leaver.</p>

<p>The Mapzen Isochrone API also allows for routes or operators to be excluded from the calculations, so one can build more
complex &ldquo;what if&rdquo; type simulations.</p>

<p>And the service does not include bike share, which really is another piece in the whole mobility puzzle that can
significantly shorten travel time (or increase travel distance).</p>

<h3>Issues and Caveats</h3>

<p>Times after midnight may run into some issues, in some places, like e.g. Vancouver or Toronto, the early morning hour
isochrones won&rsquo;t work properly using this visualization. The technical reason seems to be that some GTFS used times past
24 hours, so 25:01 for one minute past 1AM the next day. And that breaks things somewhere. The good news is it&rsquo;s just a matter
of time for this to get fixed one way or another. But for now it&rsquo;s broken. :-(</p>

<p>Also, the tools this is built on are quite fresh. So there might be some glitches and opportunities to improve. Exciting times
when services like the isochrone API by Mapzen become publicly, and freely, available.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/02/21/more-on-teardowns/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-21T10:59:27-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/02/21/more-on-teardowns</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/teardowns"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/teardowns_animated.gif" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
A little over a year ago we ran some analysis
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/18/redevelopment/">on teardowns</a>
of single family homes in the City of Vancouver. We used the City of Vancouver
open data to understand why some single family homes got torn down and other&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Relying entirely on open data, there were some important questions that could not
be answered. So together with Joe Dahmen at UBC&rsquo;s School Of Architecture And Landscape Architecture
we came back to the question
and folded in transaction data from BC Assessment to add some more details and rigor.</p>

<p>The result turned out quite similar to what our initial cruder methods came
up with, but it lead to some important refinements.</p>

<p>We won&rsquo;t go into the details of the findings here, you can
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/teardowns" target="_blank" class='btn btn-default'>read the online data story</a>
if you are interested. Instead we will go into a little more details how
the analysis was done and what is still missing.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The most critical piece that we added was transaction data, that is
which properties got sold in what year. Almost all properties that got
torn down were associated with a property transaction in the 4 years
around it getting torn down rebuilt.</p>

<p>This allowed us to refine the question from &ldquo;why did building A get torn
own and building B did not&rdquo; to ask the same question only considering
transacted buildings.</p>

<p>Conditioning on the most important determinant of a building getting torn down,
the transaction, we could focus in much better on what building-specific
parameters are driving teardowns.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>We had annual assessment data pegged at July 2005 through July 2016, although
we excluded the July 2016 data for some parts of the analysis as the value
gains that year where
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/16/2017-assessment-data/">quite extraordinary</a>
and prices have come down
a bit since then. We felt that this most recent assessment may not be a good
launching point to project the future from.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the number of variables for teardowns that we have is
quite limited. We only have good data on assessed land values, assessed
building values and lot area. For a very small subset of about 500 buildings
we also have the building age of the building that got torn down. We have
GFA estimates for buildings that got torn down after 2009 through the
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/03/05/physical-sfh-form-over-time/">analysis of LIDAR data</a>
that we did, but those estimates are quite crude and again only cover a portion of our
time frame.</p>

<p>A crucial variable that we are still missing is the actual time of the building
demolition. We inferred this from the time a new building got completed on that
property, but this inevitably introduces noise to the data. It makes it
difficult to pick the right time to calculate the relative building value. Moreover,
there may be the occasional property that got built on vacant land, so nothing got torn down.
This was less an issue for the analysis part, where we had ways to filter out such properties,
but it did cause some problems with the visualization part of the project. We did filter out
some properties manually that we could identify as being built on vacant land within
the timeframe of the visualization, namely some properties on Deering Island.</p>

<p>On top of that, the decision to demolish the building was often made long
before the building got torn down. Waiting times on demolition permits can be quite long, depending
on the property. Having access to building permit data would help sharpen
this variable. The word from the friendly open data folks is that the
City of Vancouver is working on making these public, maybe an FOI request
can help them speed up the process.</p>

<h3>Noise</h3>

<p>The most important source of noise in our data is that fact that assessment
data is only accurate <em>on average</em>. For particular buildings it can be substantially
off. We suspect that this is one of the reasons why for
buildings that are assessed to be essentially worthless,
the teardown probability tops out at a little above 60%. So someone
paying $2.5 million for a house that is worth only $10,000 to move in and live
in that house makes absolutely no sense. If the building like this did not get torn down,
we hypothesize one of three scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>The building was purchased as a pure investment vehicle and rented out
until an opportune time to re-develop or sell the property.</li>
<li>The assessment grossly undervalued the building.</li>
<li>The building was extensively renovated.</li>
</ol>


<p>We have looked through the data and have found little evidence that scenario 3 is
playing out in significant numbers. Extensive renovations show up in assessment
data via building value gains and the &ldquo;year improved&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t have
data to assess the other two hypotheses.</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>Given that limited variables we trained a handful of models on our data to see
how to best predict future teardowns. In all models we used, the relative
building value was the single most predictive variable, accounting for well over
80% of explanatory power no matter what methods we used. Moreover, the
performance of more complex machine learning models was not markedly better
that using a simple logistic regression. Similarly, dropping all other variables
except the relative building value only slightly decreased the skill of our
model.</p>

<p>One way to improve on our model is to use a proper survival analysis that
can better account for data that is only available for certain time frames.
For example, teardown early in our time frame suffer from the shortcoming that
we don&rsquo;t have transaction data reaching back far enough to link the teardown
to a transaction. Or more to the point, be able to compare it to other
transacted properties that didn&rsquo;t get torn down. Similar problems occur
at the end of our time frame, and with variables that are only available
in certain sub time frames.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/18/bumper-year-for-thumb-twiddlers/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-18T11:10:43-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/18/bumper-year-for-thumb-twiddlers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=12&amp;lat=49.2494&amp;lng=-123.1241&amp;layer=12"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs_2006_2017.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Almost a year has passed since we first noticed how
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/24/work-vs-twiddling-thumbs/">sitting on single family homes and twiddling thumbs generates more income than working</a>.
And not just at the level of individual single family households. In the
City of Vancouver, the cumulative
land value gains of just the single family homes eclipsed the cumulative taxable earnings
reported to the CRA for the entire population.</p>

<p>With the new assessment data available now, it is time to run the numbers
and see how our thumb-twiddlers fared vs workers this year. If you thought
last year&rsquo;s twiddling thumbs returns were crazy high, you better hold onto
your hats!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Work</h3>

<p>Not much changed in terms of the income people earned. CANSIM does not make the
taxfiler data freely available at the municipal level, we we will again estimate
the cumulative income for residents of the City of Vancouver by using 2010
Census data and extrapolating by applying the Metro Vancouver rate of income
growth.</p>

<p>This way we get a cumulative $22.3bn pre-tax or $18.6bn after-tax income in 2010,
<a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&amp;retrLang=eng&amp;id=1110009&amp;&amp;pattern=&amp;stByVal=1&amp;p1=1&amp;p2=37&amp;tabMode=dataTable&amp;csid=">which grew around 13% between 2010 and 2014</a>.
Extrapolating this for another two years to 2016 we estimate an income growth of around 20% since 2010,
which then pegs the cumulative income for the City of Vancouver at
$26.8bn pre-tax or $22.3bn after-tax (ignoring financial drag and other issues).</p>

<h3>Twiddling Thumbs</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare this to how much Vancouver home owner households &ldquo;earned&rdquo; last year by twiddling thumbs while sitting on their
property. To keep things simple and consistent with last year, we again focus on just the single family homes (SFH).
And again, we only consider land value changes, after all changing the
building value because of renovation or rebuilding certainly does not happen by twiddling thumbs.</p>

<p>The median SFH land value increased was $435,000 (the average was $594,005), for a cumulative land value increase
of $46.7bn, accounting for about half of the
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/16/2017-assessment-data/">total land value increase of the City of Vancouver</a>
or two thirds of the land value increase for residential (and mixed) land uses.</p>

<p>So while last year the twiddling thumbs return were still comparable to the cumulative income in the City of Vancouver,
this year the thumb twiddlers blow the income earners out of the water.
<span style="font-weight:bolder;">Just by by twiddling their thumbs, the SFH property owners alone earned twice as much
as the entire population of the
City of Vancouver did by actually working</span>. And in most cases homeowners won&rsquo;t pay taxes on
their thumb-twiddle earnings, although the
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/10/04/secondary-suites-and-taxes/">CRA recently made it harder with their new reporting rules</a>.</p>

<p>We are glossing over a couple of details here, for example the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, and costs like
property taxes and property transfer tax are not taken into account.</p>

<p>Of course, comparing income from work to income from twiddling thumbs is not entirely fair. The income from twiddling thumbs
is frozen in the property until the owner sells. But gains accumulate over the years, and eventually everyone sells and realizes
the gains (or passes them on to the next generation). And it&rsquo;s always good to remember that
&ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/GRIDSVancouver/status/813516103490015232">house-rich cash-poor homeowners are one transaction away from simply being rich renters</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>The Long Term</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/values?filter=sfh&zoom=13&lat=49.2482&lng=-123.1213&layer=25&mapBase=2&year=2016"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs_animated_2017.gif" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
Most people don&rsquo;t trade houses like stocks, so what really matters is the long term gains, not the year to year changes. The 11 year
timeframe for which we have data roughly matches the average holding time for a single family house. The year over year
changes in land value vary dramatically, as the image shows and can be explored further using the
<a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/values?filter=sfh&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2482&amp;lng=-123.1213&amp;layer=25&amp;mapBase=2&amp;year=2016">interactive version</a>.</p>

<p>Over 11 years, the single family home land value quadrupled. The median (nominal) single family home land value increase over that timespan
was $1,233,000, or $112,000 per year. Broken down further, that&rsquo;s $2,339,000 ($213,000 per year) for the median west side home
and $1,031,000 ($94,000 per year) for the median east side home.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=sfh&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2494&amp;lng=-123.1241&amp;layer=12"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs_2006_2017.png" style="width:50%;float:right;"></a>
We <a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=sfh&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2494&amp;lng=-123.1241&amp;layer=12">mapped the land value gain averaged over 11 years</a>.
We can observe that the average yearly increase depends on the square footage of the property as well as the location. The rates are mostly uniform
throughout the city (with some notable exceptions), but properties starting out with a higher value will see higher total value
increases. It&rsquo;s probably fair to say that even using the 11 year average, most homeowners &ldquo;earned&rdquo; more money twiddling thumbs
than pursuing a more traditional employment.</p>

<h3>Hourly Rate for Twiddling Thumbs</h3>

<p>Using the <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/24/work-vs-twiddling-thumbs/">same methods as last year</a>
we can compute the hourly earnings of thumb twiddlers. For the July 2016 to July 2017 timeframe, thumb twiddlers
in the City of Vancouver averaged a tidy $239 per hour.
Using the 11 year averaged numbers instead of focusing on just the last year we still get a healthy average
thumb twiddling rate of $62 per hour.</p>

<p>Another bumper year for thumb twiddlers!
Considering to change your line work to thumb twiddling? To bad thumb twiddling is so unaffordable!</p>

<h3>Data Dump</h3>

<p>Here is the raw output of the stats run on the single family properties for anyone interested.</p>

<p>The total number of units for the 2006 to 2017 analysis are a little lower since not all properties can be traced over that time
period without resorting to more tedious analysis.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/81?layer=101&amp;mapBase=2"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/coveted_vote.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Earlier this month the province increased the threshold for the homeowner grant from $1.2 million to $1.6 million dollars.
It&rsquo;s an election year, and with the BC Assessment data for the City of Vancouver now being available via their
<a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">open data catalogue</a>
we can ask who exactly this move was targeting.</p>

<p>Restricted to the City of Vancouver, the answer is quite simple. There are about 24,000 single family homes, 1,200 duplex units and 4,000 condo units
in that bracket.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,total_1200000_1600000]&amp;layer=101&amp;mapBase=2"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/coveted_sfh_vote.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
If we focus in on just the
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,total_1200000_1600000]&amp;layer=101&amp;mapBase=2">single family homes</a>,
which make up the vast majority of the units in that bracket, we see that they
are (almost) entirely located in East Vancouver. In fact, we can see how Main Street delineates these properties quite neatly.
In fact, there are fewer than 500 single family homes west of Main in that bracket.</p>

<p>One could be lead to think that Main Street is the &ldquo;$1.6m line&rdquo;. But of the single family homes
east of Main, these only make up just over half of the properties there,
there are almost as many that are
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,total_1600000]&amp;layer=101&amp;mapBase=2">assessed over $1.6m</a>
and <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,total__1200000]&amp;layer=101&amp;mapBase=2">almost 2,000 assessed under $1.2m</a>.</p>

<h4>Changing Homeowner Grant Status</h4>

<p>There are a number of single family homes where the homeowner grant status changed between 2016 and 2017.
There are about 3,100 single family homes who did not qualify for the homeowner
grant in 2016, but do now. And about 1000 that did qualify in 2016 but won&rsquo;t this year.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, there are
1000 single family homes with 2016 assessment below $1.2m and 2017 assessment over $1.6m. I pity them,
having to pay an extra $50/month in property taxes just because the province did not care about them
enough to set the new threshold higher than $1.6m.</p>

<p>To round things up, there were a little under 500 duplex and condo units that did not qualify for the homeowner
grant in 2016 and do in 2017, and under 200 that did qualify in 2016 and don&rsquo;t now.</p>

<h3>How to get the grant if you are renting?</h3>

<p>You can&rsquo;t. And your landlord can&rsquo;t either. No matter how much your unit is worth, the province won&rsquo;t be cutting
any checks to lower your rent by $50/month.
The homeowner grant is just one of the many perks exclusively available home owners.</p>
