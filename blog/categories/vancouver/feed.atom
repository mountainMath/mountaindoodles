    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been lots of talk about old homes being torn down and replaced in Vancouver. The likeliest targets are houses
 of relatively low value sitting on expensive land. So how many teardown candidates are there in Vancouver, and where
 in Vancouver are they located?</p>

<p>To answer this used data from <a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">Vancouver&rsquo;s open data catalogue</a>
 to build an interactive map to explore the low end of the building stock. More specifically, we set a somewhat arbitrary
 ratio of (assessed) house value to total (assessed) property value (house + land) of 5% and label everything below that
 a &ldquo;teardown candidate&rdquo;.</p>

<p>On the level of the individual property the &ldquo;teardown candidate&rdquo; designation might be unfair, maybe the property is a
 heritage home with prohibitive rehabilitation costs, or BC Assessment has failed to properly account for recent
 renovations. That&rsquo;s why the map will display more detailed property information to aid further investigation on the
 individual property level.</p>

<p>The short answer is that almost one in three properties in Vancouver fall into this category. And they are distributed
 quite evenly across all of Vancouver with some areas like downtown looking a little better.</p>

<p>Take a look at the map below the fold and explore for yourself. You will need a reasonably fast
 computer and modern browser to enjoy the map, it contains lots of data and may feel quite slow on mobile devices.</p>
