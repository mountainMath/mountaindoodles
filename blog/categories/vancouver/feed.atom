    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/gboeing/status/816331801266262017">Geoff Boeing&rsquo;s excellent package</a>
to generate Jane Jacobs style street grid images. It&rsquo;s lots of fun to compare different cities that way.</p>

<p>It can be hard to represent one city by one square mile, so I thought it would be neat to use this
to compare different parts of Vancouver. Some common themes emerge for the central parts,
the more outlying areas display very differnet patterns.</p>

<p>So I <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/d/88803d79ab2a3e637e2cce7fc151423d">dropped a couple of points on a map</a>, downloaded
the geojson and ran the script below. These are the results:</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/18/bumper-year-for-thumb-twiddlers/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-18T11:10:43-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/18/bumper-year-for-thumb-twiddlers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=12&amp;lat=49.2494&amp;lng=-123.1241&amp;layer=12"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs_2006_2017.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Almost a year has passed since we first noticed how
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/24/work-vs-twiddling-thumbs/">sitting on single family homes and twiddling thumbs generates more income than working</a>.
And not just at the level of individual single family households. In the
City of Vancouver, the cumulative
land value gains of just the single family homes eclipsed the cumulative taxable earnings
reported to the CRA for the entire population.</p>

<p>With the new assessment data available now, it is time to run the numbers
and see how our thumb-twiddlers fared vs workers this year. If you thought
last year&rsquo;s twiddling thumbs returns were crazy high, you better hold onto
your hats!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Work</h3>

<p>Not much changed in terms of the income people earned. CANSIM does not make the
taxfiler data freely available at the municipal level, we we will again estimate
the cumulative income for residents of the City of Vancouver by using 2010
Census data and extrapolating by applying the Metro Vancouver rate of income
growth.</p>

<p>This way we get a cumulative $22.3bn pre-tax or $18.6bn after-tax income in 2010,
<a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&amp;retrLang=eng&amp;id=1110009&amp;&amp;pattern=&amp;stByVal=1&amp;p1=1&amp;p2=37&amp;tabMode=dataTable&amp;csid=">which grew around 13% between 2010 and 2014</a>.
Extrapolating this for another two years to 2016 we estimate an income growth of around 20% since 2010,
which then pegs the cumulative income for the City of Vancouver at
$26.8bn pre-tax or $22.3bn after-tax (ignoring financial drag and other issues).</p>

<h3>Twiddling Thumbs</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare this to how much Vancouver home owner households &ldquo;earned&rdquo; last year by twiddling thumbs while sitting on their
property. To keep things simple and consistent with last year, we again focus on just the single family homes (SFH).
And again, we only consider land value changes, after all changing the
building value because of renovation or rebuilding certainly does not happen by twiddling thumbs.</p>

<p>The median SFH land value increased was $435,000 (the average was $594,005), for a cumulative land value increase
of $46.7bn, accounting for about half of the
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/16/2017-assessment-data/">total land value increase of the City of Vancouver</a>
or two thirds of the land value increase for residential (and mixed) land uses.</p>

<p>So while last year the twiddling thumbs return were still comparable to the cumulative income in the City of Vancouver,
this year the thumb twiddlers blow the income earners out of the water.
<span style="font-weight:bolder;">Just by by twiddling their thumbs, the SFH property owners alone earned twice as much
as the entire population of the
City of Vancouver did by actually working</span>. And in most cases homeowners won&rsquo;t pay taxes on
their thumb-twiddle earnings, although the
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/10/04/secondary-suites-and-taxes/">CRA recently made it harder with their new reporting rules</a>.</p>

<p>We are glossing over a couple of details here, for example the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, and costs like
property taxes and property transfer tax are not taken into account.</p>

<p>Of course, comparing income from work to income from twiddling thumbs is not entirely fair. The income from twiddling thumbs
is frozen in the property until the owner sells. But gains accumulate over the years, and eventually everyone sells and realizes
the gains (or passes them on to the next generation). And it&rsquo;s always good to remember that
&ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/GRIDSVancouver/status/813516103490015232">house-rich cash-poor homeowners are one transaction away from simply being rich renters</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>The Long Term</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/values?filter=sfh&zoom=13&lat=49.2482&lng=-123.1213&layer=25&mapBase=2&year=2016"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs_animated_2017.gif" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
Most people don&rsquo;t trade houses like stocks, so what really matters is the long term gains, not the year to year changes. The 11 year
timeframe for which we have data roughly matches the average holding time for a single family house. The year over year
changes in land value vary dramatically, as the image shows and can be explored further using the
<a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/values?filter=sfh&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2482&amp;lng=-123.1213&amp;layer=25&amp;mapBase=2&amp;year=2016">interactive version</a>.</p>

<p>Over 11 years, the single family home land value quadrupled. The median (nominal) single family home land value increase over that timespan
was $1,233,000, or $112,000 per year. Broken down further, that&rsquo;s $2,339,000 ($213,000 per year) for the median west side home
and $1,031,000 ($94,000 per year) for the median east side home.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=sfh&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2494&amp;lng=-123.1241&amp;layer=12"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/twiddling_thumbs_2006_2017.png" style="width:50%;float:right;"></a>
We <a href="https://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=sfh&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2494&amp;lng=-123.1241&amp;layer=12">mapped the land value gain averaged over 11 years</a>.
We can observe that the average yearly increase depends on the square footage of the property as well as the location. The rates are mostly uniform
throughout the city (with some notable exceptions), but properties starting out with a higher value will see higher total value
increases. It&rsquo;s probably fair to say that even using the 11 year average, most homeowners &ldquo;earned&rdquo; more money twiddling thumbs
than pursuing a more traditional employment.</p>

<h3>Hourly Rate for Twiddling Thumbs</h3>

<p>Using the <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/24/work-vs-twiddling-thumbs/">same methods as last year</a>
we can compute the hourly earnings of thumb twiddlers. For the July 2016 to July 2017 timeframe, thumb twiddlers
in the City of Vancouver averaged a tidy $239 per hour.
Using the 11 year averaged numbers instead of focusing on just the last year we still get a healthy average
thumb twiddling rate of $62 per hour.</p>

<p>Another bumper year for thumb twiddlers!
Considering to change your line work to thumb twiddling? To bad thumb twiddling is so unaffordable!</p>

<h3>Data Dump</h3>

<p>Here is the raw output of the stats run on the single family properties for anyone interested.</p>

<p>The total number of units for the 2006 to 2017 analysis are a little lower since not all properties can be traced over that time
period without resorting to more tedious analysis.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/17/the-coveted-2m-6m-vote/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-17T16:19:03-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/17/the-coveted-2m-6m-vote</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/81?layer=101&amp;mapBase=2"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/coveted_vote.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Earlier this month the province increased the threshold for the homeowner grant from $1.2 million to $1.6 million dollars.
It&rsquo;s an election year, and with the BC Assessment data for the City of Vancouver now being available via their
<a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">open data catalogue</a>
we can ask who exactly this move was targeting.</p>

<p>Restricted to the City of Vancouver, the answer is quite simple. There are about 24,000 single family homes, 1,200 duplex units and 4,000 condo units
in that bracket.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,total_1200000_1600000]&amp;layer=101&amp;mapBase=2"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/coveted_sfh_vote.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
If we focus in on just the
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,total_1200000_1600000]&amp;layer=101&amp;mapBase=2">single family homes</a>,
which make up the vast majority of the units in that bracket, we see that they
are (almost) entirely located in East Vancouver. In fact, we can see how Main Street delineates these properties quite neatly.
In fact, there are fewer than 500 single family homes west of Main in that bracket.</p>

<p>One could be lead to think that Main Street is the &ldquo;$1.6m line&rdquo;. But of the single family homes
east of Main, these only make up just over half of the properties there,
there are almost as many that are
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,total_1600000]&amp;layer=101&amp;mapBase=2">assessed over $1.6m</a>
and <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,total__1200000]&amp;layer=101&amp;mapBase=2">almost 2,000 assessed under $1.2m</a>.</p>

<h4>Changing Homeowner Grant Status</h4>

<p>There are a number of single family homes where the homeowner grant status changed between 2016 and 2017.
There are about 3,100 single family homes who did not qualify for the homeowner
grant in 2016, but do now. And about 1000 that did qualify in 2016 but won&rsquo;t this year.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, there are
1000 single family homes with 2016 assessment below $1.2m and 2017 assessment over $1.6m. I pity them,
having to pay an extra $50/month in property taxes just because the province did not care about them
enough to set the new threshold higher than $1.6m.</p>

<p>To round things up, there were a little under 500 duplex and condo units that did not qualify for the homeowner
grant in 2016 and do in 2017, and under 200 that did qualify in 2016 and don&rsquo;t now.</p>

<h3>How to get the grant if you are renting?</h3>

<p>You can&rsquo;t. And your landlord can&rsquo;t either. No matter how much your unit is worth, the province won&rsquo;t be cutting
any checks to lower your rent by $50/month.
The homeowner grant is just one of the many perks exclusively available home owners.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/16/2017-assessment-data/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-16T19:04:19-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/16/2017-assessment-data</id>

The friendly folks at
<a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">Vancouver Open Data</a> just
<a href="https://twitter.com/VanOpenData/status/688060388190097408">updated their property assessment data</a> with the fresh 2017
property tax assessments. Time to run the script to update the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">Vancouver Assessment Map</a>
with the new data, just <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/17/updated-vancouver-assessment-data/">like we did last year</a>.</p>

<p>For now we just updated our standard visuals and computed some overall statistics. We will take a closer look at the data over the coming days.</p>

<h4>Maps</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>By now we have a variety of maps that highlight different aspects of Vancouver real estate, and after running the import scripts they
automatically serve the newest data. Our basic
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">interactive assessment map</a> offers a variety of ways to slice and display the data. It&rsquo;s
mostly focused on functionality, some of which we described in
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/17/updated-vancouver-assessment-data/">last year&rsquo;s post</a>, as well as other posts like
the one on <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/24/work-vs-twiddling-thumbs/">twiddling thumbs vs working</a>.</p>

<p>We also have interactive views focusing on how real estate prices varied over time, for example the <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/04/01/on-dirt-and-houses/">houses and dirt map</a>
that separates out (inflation adjusted) values of the structures and the land, and also allows to filter by type of housing, to animate changes over time.</p>

<p>For people that like simpler maps we also have a <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/values?filter=[sfh]&amp;zoom=13&amp;layer=9">plain total (nominal) value over time map</a>
that allows to interactively step through the years and see how single family house values in Vancouver changed over time. Here we also
added the ability to visualize year-over-year value changes, which also hints at how BC Assessment changed their valuation
algorithm over the years.</p>

<h4>The Data</h4>

<p>The data originates with BC Assessment, which estimates land and building values of each property based on recent sales
of comparable properties. The values are pegged at July 1 of each year, with the the most recent available now being July 1 2016.
The estimates for the values do not reflect changes in the market since then. Moreover, the estimates can be quite off on an individual
property level, but are unbiased. That means that any statistics derived from a large subsample should fairly accurately
reflect actual market conditions for July 1st. Lastly, the assessed values will still change a bit as some will be successfully appealed.</p>

<p>City of Vancouver, as well as the City of Surrey, make this data available for general use through their open data portal, which
allows us to create these maps. The format of the data the municipalities are giving out through their open data portal is
different, so lazy me is only importing data from City of Vancouver. Sadly, BC Assessment does not make this data
generally available province wide for us to make province wide maps.</p>

<p>While BC Assessment makes this data available on their <a href="https://evaluebc.bcassessment.ca">eValue website</a> for browsing individual
properties and also provides it in bulk to researchers, the attached license does not allow the thematic mapping of individual properties.</p>

<p>The motivation behind the map was to understand the building stock, so in the maps as well as the summary statistics below
we filter out parks and some other properties.</p>

<p>The new city dataset does not include the 2017 tax levy, so our maps still only show the 2016 tax levies until CoV updated their dataset.</p>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/17/updated-vancouver-assessment-data/">last year&rsquo;s post</a> we ran some
quick summary statistics to break down the numbers by neighbourhood. Instead of listing the most recent land and building value
increases by neighbourhood we stuck everything into an interactive graph for the entire time span between 2006 and 2017 tax years.
Use the dropdown menus to drill down
into city neighbourhoods, view values for all properties or just residential properties and display as total value or year-over-year
percentage change.</p>

<p>The last year again
saw an huge increase in property values. For the City of Vancouver land values were up 35% and building values 10%, with the land
value increase setting a record for the timeframe for which we have data. The increases become even more pronounced when we zero in
on residential property only.</p>

    <updated>2016-12-13T20:10:22-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/12/13/updated-property-tax-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The property tax data for the City of Vancouver has been available for a while now, and with new assessment data becoming
available soon everyone&rsquo;s worried about what their property taxes will look like. The City just passed a 3.9% increase
in their budget, so on average everyone will pay 3.9% more taxes than they did last year.</p>

<p>The exact change in property taxes varies from property to property. There is a <a href="https://patrickjohnstone.ca/2013/01/on-assessments-and-mil-rates.html">nice overview</a>
on how this works in general, for the City of Vancouver there is an added complication of land value averaging meant to
soften sudden land value increases, that effectively serves to lower taxes for single family homeowners in a rising market.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s all to abstract for you, keep reading.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=15&lat=49.2672&lng=-123.1449" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/pt_animated.gif" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
To make the change in property taxes a little more transparent I have added a time slider to my
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=15&amp;lat=49.2672&amp;lng=-123.1449">Tax Density by Land Use Map</a> that I have
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/03/02/property-taxes-and-land-use/">described previously</a>. So now people can
go back in time and see how property taxes changed and compare it to their neighbours. At the same time I
have updated the data on my <a href="">regular assessment data maps</a> to be based on the 2016 tax data, more background on the
tax data is in <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/05/31/density-in-vancouver/">this post</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the <a class='btn' href="https://mountainmath.ca/assessment_gl/map?zoom=14&lat=49.2814&lng=-123.1312" target="_blank">interactive map</a>.</p>

<p>This map also serves as a good reality check on the tax productivity of the land.</p>

<p>Some caveats: I am missing data for some years or some
properties, and this map aggregates property taxes for
all strata lots in a stratified property, you will have to dive into the data yourself if you want to see how it changed
on individual strata lots. Zoning and land use data stay at 2016 and don&rsquo;t animate back in time because of availability.</p>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://mapzen.com">Mapzen</a> for making it so ridiculously easy to make these maps and for
<a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">Vancouver Open Data</a> and
<a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/data">Metro Vancouver Open Data</a> for making that data available.</p>
