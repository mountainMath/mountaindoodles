    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/584#11/49.2389/-123.0977"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/non-primary.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
There has been some <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/vancouver/bcs-empty-home-problem-moving-beyond-just-vancouver/article34130746/">recent confusion</a>
that got <a href="http://vancouversun.com/business/local-business/three-transit-oriented-communities-in-metro-rival-coal-harbour-for-empty-or-underused-housing">confounded further</a>
about transit-oriented development
in Vancouver harbouring a large number of non-primary residence homes. Good data is
important in moving forward in Vancouver&rsquo;s crazy housing market. Without proper
context, a couple of data points can serve to paint a very misleading picture
of what is happening. So I decided to fill in some gaps on the very narrow
question of understanding the CT level numbers that get tossed around.
No deep analysis, just looking into the CTs in question to see where the numbers that the census
picked up came from.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>To understand the overall rate of 24.4% non-primary residence dwelling units at the Joyce census tract,
one should split the area into the Wall Centre Central Park development (99.2% non primary residence units)
and the rest of the CT (3.4% non-primary residence units).</p>

<p>To understand the Marine Gateway CT (24% non-primary residence dwellings),
it should be split inte the block with Marine Gateway development (13.7%),
the block containing the EC2 developemnt (67.4%), and the rest (10.1%).</p>

<p>Comparing any of these very recent developments to the much older Coal Harbour makes no sense.
Coal Harbor is still &ldquo;filling in&rdquo; although at a subbornly slow rate. It will be interesting
to see if the new vacancy tax can help speed that up.</p>

<h3>Marine Gateway</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/@49.2114587,-123.1170704,3a,75y,94.33h,114.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdPusgUyW9gIfMiDEYVcduw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/ec2_streetview.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a></p>

<p>To understand the 24% non-primary residence units in the census tract containing the
Marine Gateway development, we split the area into three parts.
The block with the Marine Gateway
development has in 460 dwelling units, 63 (13.7%) of which were found not to be
primary residences. The block north of that containing EC2 had 570 dwelling units
394 (67.4%) of which were not used as primary dwellings. The remaining part of the
CT as 1,507 dwelling units, 152 (10.1%) of which were not used as primary dwellings.</p>

<p>What we see here quite nicely is how the rates of non-primary residence units
are changing as the buildings they are in get older. Both Marine Gateway and EC2 are fairly
recent projects, but Marine Gatway itself got completed about a year before EC2,
and have significantly lower rates of non-primary residence homes.</p>

<p>What needs further sleuthing is the rate of 10.1% for the rest of the CT,
which is significantly higher than the baseline of 5.4% in 2011. There are no
other larger pockets of increase of non-primary residence units in that area.
This is might be best analysed in conjunction with similar increases in non-primary
residence dwellings in some other single
family neighbourhoods and goes beyond the scope of this short note.</p>

</ul>


<h3>Joyce-Collingwood</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/@49.2342503,-123.0248672,3a,75y,147.43h,109.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s22enJ14Z6DaYnXcsXcqYqw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/wall_centre.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
The story for Joyce-Collingwood is quite a bit cleaner (but holds some data complexities that
manifest themselves in geocoding changes between censuses that can mess with fine-grained data).</p>

<p>The articles focus on the increase by 609 CT-level non-primary residence dwelling units at Joyce. The articles
hypothesise that &ldquo;Speculation is one of our prime suspects&rdquo; and
&ldquo;We don’t know why, but we know it’s concentrated in a few neighbourhoods.&rdquo;
without making any effort to look beyond CT-level data to find out.</p>

<p>Diving in we see immediately that the Dissemination Block at the north-west
corner of Kingsway and Boundary had 707 non-primary residence dwelling units in 2016,
vs 3 in 2011. That&rsquo;s a net change of 704 non-primary residence dwelling units
in just that block. It
block contains the Wall Centre Central Park development, that completed
shortly before the census. The census counted 713 units, only 6 of
which it found occupied.</p>

<p>At the same time, population dropped by 161 people in this block, as the
previous single family homes made way to the new development, easily
explaining the drop in population by 57 in the CT level data that
<a href="https://twitter.com/Ayan604/status/848952053435047936">has people scratching their heads</a>.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the rate of non-primary residence buildings once we take out the
Wall Centre Central Park that got completed just before the census?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 3.4%. Which explains why Jennifer Gray-Grant, executive director at Collingwood Neighbourhood House,
was quoted finding the stat of 24% non-primary residence home &ldquo;perplexing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to look back through time to see
<a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/400#16/49.2348/-123.0310">the rates in 2006</a>, when
the area around Aberdeen Park had 18.1% non-primary residence units. I am guessing
that some major building projects got completed in the year before the census,
by 2011 the number of non-primary residence units dropped dramatically.</p>

<h4>Data:</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/584#16/49.2358/-123.0287">Non-primary residences</a></li>

<li><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/650#16/49.2358/-123.0287">Total change in non-primary residence dwellings</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Olympic Village</h3>

<p>The high rate of non-primary resident units in 2011 in the Oplymic Village should
be seen in the context of the City&rsquo;s decision not to sell the units below cost
but hold onto the units and sell them
at a later point when the market recovers, which eventually paid off.</p>

<p>To understand the current overall rate of 9.4% non-primary residence units, it is
instructional to simply zoom into the block level data and observe how the
rates change depending on the completion time of the building.</p>

    <updated>2017-03-22T13:28:51-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/03/22/comparing-censuses</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/624#14/49.2608/-123.1556"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/pop_change.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
It&rsquo;s great to have fresh census data to play with. Right now we only have
three variables, population, dwellings and households. There is still lots
of <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/02/10/2016-census-data/">interesting information that can be extracted</a>.</p>

<p>So we started exploring in our <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/03/06/rs-population-change/">last post</a>,
things get really interesting when looking at change between censuses. But as we noted, there are
several technical difficulties that need to be overcome.</p>

<p>So we at CensusMapper took that as and invitation to do what we love most: breaking down barriers.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The biggest difficulty in comparing censuses is that census geographies change over time to adapt to new
demographic realities on the ground. Whenever that happens, there is no easy way to compare data across
censuses.</p>

<h3>Custom Tabulations</h3>

<p>The best way to compare data across censuses is to pull a custom tabulation for data on a common geography,
there are a couple of things to keep in mind though:</p>

<p>1) It costs money (or at least time if part of a specific research project with access to a StatCan data centre),
2) it takes time to complete a custom tabulation, and
3) custom tabulations are typically not available at fine geographic levels.</p>

<p>For these reasons, comparing data across censuses is usually confined to select university research projects
or well-resourced private interest. And to make matters worse, custom tabulations are rarely shared. I have
asked university research groups if they were willing to share custom tabulations through CensusMapper, but got turned down
every time so far. While the
<a href="http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_F6765465.html?OpenDocument">Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications</a>,
postulates that research needs to be published in open access journals and the data also needs to be made available, in practice
research groups often keep their data locked up long after publication.</p>

<p>But some public agencies do make their custom tabulations available, for example the City of Vancouver has custom tabulations
for neighbourhood boundaries <a href="http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm">available on their open data catalogue</a>.</p>

<h3>Comparable Regions</h3>

<p>But even without custom tabulations we can compare regions if they have not changed across censuses. For example, we can compare
how the City of Vancouver or Metro Vancouver have change over time by tracing them through censuses, as their geography has not
changed. Census regions are tracked through their unique region identifier, which allows people to establish
timelines for regions. When doing so one quickly runs into issues with this approach though.</p>

<p>Just because a region has the same name and unique geographic identifier does not guarantee that the region has not changed. Simple
examples of this are Census Metropolitan Areas that can change quite dramatically over time without this being reflected in the name
or region identifier. For example, Ottawa, Montreal or Abbotsford were all expanded, some substantially) from the 2011 to the 2016 census.</p>

<p>For example, by just comparing Census Metropolitan Area data, Montreal&rsquo;s population grew by 7.2% between 2011 and 2016. But a good
chunk of that was simply due to the geographic region of the CMA being expanded, taking the 2016 expanded region as a base and
including all people that lived in that region in 2011, including the ones that lived outside of the 2011 CMA of Montreal but
that are now included in the 2016 CMA, the region&rsquo;s population only grew by 4.2%.</p>

<p>On top of large changes like this, many smaller regions have undergone slight boundary adjustments while keeping their unique identifier,
which move some people from one geographic region to another. And as one drills down into finer geographies one can easily
find geocoding errors in the data, where people were moved from one region to another between censuses without any region
adjustment taking place. These geocoding problems may persists in custom tabulations, but they are likely to even out as one
moves to higher aggregation levels.</p>

<h3>CensusMapper comparable regions</h3>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/648"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/pop_adjusted.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
At CensusMapper we decided that it would be in the general interest to be able to compare standard census variables
across all aggregation levels. So we wrote some scripts to create a &ldquo;least common denominator&rdquo; tiling for all of
Canada for all aggregation levels,
ranging from Census Blocks to all of Canada. The idea is to keep regions that have not changed and, for regions that did change,
join regions together in a way that the joins match again across censuses. While this sounds simple in principle, there are lots
of issues and pitfalls along the way. Hopefully we have properly dealt with all of them now. We have done some testing, and
there are still have 285 regions (36 CTs, 245 CSDs and 4 CMAs) where the adjusted and computed 2011 population counts don&rsquo;t
quite add up. For example, 348 people were moved between Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam in this fashion, most of it due to an
adjustment between CTs 9330287.01 and 9330291.01 that is not due to a change in geographic boundary. In the example of Airdrie
trading 705 people with Rocky view this is associated with a change of the census geography, but no change in name or
geographic identifier. In most cases the adjustment is much smaller than this. Even more extreme than Airdrie is the case
of CTs 5350512.00 and 5350511.01 in Mississauga that swapped 1074 people without any apparent boundary change.</p>

<p>We have a <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/648">map that highlights all these difference at or above the CT zoom level</a>, and in all maps we shade areas with adjusted
population counts and we indicate the actual population adjustment on hover.</p>

<h3>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/588#14/49.2613/-123.1568"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/dw_change.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
So what does all of this buy us? For now, we get comprehensive maps comparing population, dwellings and households across the
2011 and 2016 censuses at all geographic levels, including Dissemination Blocks. As new census data rolls in, we will be
able to compare data down to the Dissemination Area level. That&rsquo;s pretty cool, we think.</p>

<p>What could be bad about this? Census data is far from perfect. And mapping differences tends to bring out the problems in
Census Data. Incorrectly enumerated dwellings, households or population, geocoding issues, as well as changes in geographies.</p>

<p>And things start to get really ugly when the rest of the census data comes in where statistical rounding was applied. Even if
everything was perfectly enumerated and geocoded, statistical rounding means that inevitably some areas will have census data
that has been rounded up in one year and rounded down in the next. And taking differences will bring this out very strongly,
especially at the Dissemination Area level. It is hard to overstate the effect of this, statistical rounding means that when
mapping change at small aggregation levels we will map lots of statistical noise.</p>

<p>There is however still value in showing and
working with differences of census variables at small aggregation levels, but the results are much harder to interpret.
One very simple workflow that we use regularly is to generally use Census Tract level data, but zoom in to Dissemination Areas
when we want more context for particular Census Tract values. Doing this, salted and peppered with a good dose of caution and
ideally some ground truthing, we can greatly refine our insights in what is going on in that Census Tract.</p>

<p>For this
reason we are decided to, at this point, keep fine grained data publicly available. We are aware that this will lead to
some people misinterpreting census data, but this is already happening at any aggregation level and is generally not a
sufficient argument to lock up data in our view. We may add more visual aids to warn the user of unreliable results, like adding
pattern shading to results that could be dramatically effected by small difference errors due to statistical rounding or
sampling/enumeration issues.</p>

<h3>Maps</h3>

<p>We opened up a number of maps on CensusMapper that explore changes between the 2011 and 2016 censuses down to the block level.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/02/10/2016-census-data/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-10T20:27:10-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/02/10/2016-census-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/583"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/van_pop_change.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Finally the first batch of 2016 census data has arrived on Tuesday AM and
CensusMapper was updated with the new census numbers by mid-morning.</p>

<p>Dissemination Block data was a little harder to find, but with the help
of some friendly StatCan people I finally managed to locate the data and
add that too this afternoon.</p>

<p>Time for writing up some observations. I am hoping to find time to do
this regularly as more data gets released.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The first batch of data only comes with three variables: Population, dwellings and households.
And two more, a data quality flag indicating areas with incomplete enumeration and the area of
each geographic region. Area itself is more tricky than it seems at first, one has
to make decisions what to count. Lakes? Rivers? National or Regional Parks?</p>

<p>Next to these variables, we also got the corresponding 2011 population for all geographic
regions at the CT/CSD level and above to aid the comparison, but these
were not available at the DA or DB level.</p>

<p>The variables seem straight forward, but nothing is simple when it comes to big projects like a census,
so it might we worthwhile to spend a little bit of time looking at them.</p>

<h3>Population</h3>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/591"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/van_pop_density.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
The quintessential census variable counts the number of people in each census region. With the exception
of people that have a primary residence elsewhere in Canada or abroad. There are several reasons for this,
the simples one is to avoid the double-counting of people.</p>

<h3>Dwellings</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Dwellings&rdquo; is short for &ldquo;private dwellings&rdquo;, this does not count collective dwellings
like prisons, student dorms, hospitals or nursery homes or even some coops. This can lead
to interesting situation where there are zero private dwellings (and zero households) but non-zero population.
Metro Vancouver has 45 such dissemination blocks. But these people are
only counted if they don&rsquo;t have a primary residence somewhere else, which
often is the case for students in dorms. But not for all students, as the
Dissemination Block on UBC campus that&rsquo;s wedged between NW Marine, University,
Lower Mall and Agronomy shows.
It has zero dwellings, zero households, but a population of 890 people.</p>

<h3>Households</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;dwellings, occupied by usual residents&rdquo; is also called &ldquo;households&rdquo;. It
refers to a private dwelling that is used as a primary residence, and the inhabitants
make up a household. If inhabitants of a dwelling only live there temporarily and/or has
a primary residence somewhere else in Canada or abroad, then they are not
counted in the population nor the household counts.</p>

<h3>Unoccupied Dwellings</h3>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/584"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/van_unoccupied.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
The difference between dwellings and households is &ldquo;dwellings, not occupied by usual residents&rdquo;. Essentially, that&rsquo;s
dwellings that are not used as primary residences. It&rsquo;s a fun variable to look at, and it
is available at the very fine Census Block level. In some cases, a Census Block can contain just one apartment building.</p>

<h3>Mixing Variables</h3>

<p>The fun starts when we mix these variables. And compare them to the previous
censuses. And there are lots of ways to do that, here are a few:</p>

<h4>Population Change</h4>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/583"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/van_pop_change.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
The most immediate variable to look at is population change. We have
complete Canada-wide data at the CT level or above, but if we are really
interested we can also view this data for DAs and DBs that stayed the same
across the census years. The issue with doing that is that some regions will have
not data, and one has to be very careful not to read too much into an incomplete
dataset. Which is why I usually don&rsquo;t like giving out maps that contain incomplete data like this.
But this is great for diving into specific regions to get more information.</p>

<h4>Dwelling Change</h4>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/588"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/van_dw_change.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
This is a great way to see where more dwellings got built. This only measures
net changes, so even if a region shows zero dwelling increase, there could have
been quite a bit of construction in the area. In particular, if houses with secondary
suites get torn down and replaced by houses without secondary suites, it will
show up as a decline in the number of dwelling units.</p>

<h4>Non-primary residence dwellings</h4>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/586"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/van_uo_change.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
More formally, these are &ldquo;dwellings not occupied by usual residents&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s
the difference between dwellings and households and the object of continued
scrutiny in Vancouver. And a good portion of these are the target of the
upcoming empty home tax to either monetize non-primary resident homes or
nudge them into the rental market.</p>

<h4>Household size change</h4>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/590"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/van_hs_change.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
A big part of population change is the change in household size. Canada wide the
trend to smaller households is continuing. That means that if the number of dwellings
and the rate of unoccupied dwellings in a region remain unchanged, then the
population in the area will decline if it follows the national trend to
smaller household size.</p>

<h3>Population Change Null Sum Game</h3>

<p>From looking at CensusMapper, the variable that got by far the most attention
nationally in the past three days is Population Change. It&rsquo;s great to
see where population grew or declined. But almost immediately people wonder
why population change was different in one region compared to another.</p>

<p>The first step to this is the Population Null Sum Game. You need the</p>

<ul>
<li>Dwelling Change</li>
<li>Change in Unoccupied Dwellings</li>
<li>Change in Household size</li>
</ul>


<p>to play. The game is then to express Population Change in terms of those three,
and thus &ldquo;explaining&rdquo; population change in terms of these variables. There are
of course other ways to split up the Population Change variable, but I find
this a useful one.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Lauster kicked the game off
<a href="https://homefreesociology.wordpress.com/2017/02/10/if-you-build-it-will-they-come/">with this great post</a>.
Let&rsquo;s follow up his inter-municipal level analysis with some intra-municipal numbers.</p>

<p>We will focus on the City of Vancouver only. People are welcome to use CensusMapper
to repeat this for whatever region they are interested in. Vancouver has the
nice advantage that at the dissemination area geography only on change was made.
A 2011 downtown DA got split into two for 2016. That makes it very easy to carry
this out at the DA level.</p>

<h3>Components of Population Change</h3>

<p>First we refine our variables a little bit it seems more interesting to use the rate of unoccupied builings as a variable,
rather than the number of these. We want to express population change <code>Δpop</code> as a
linear combination of</p>

<ul>
<li>Dwelling change <code>Δdw</code></li>
<li>Change in ratio of unoccupied dwellings <code>Δur</code></li>
<li>Change in household size <code>Δhs</code></li>
</ul>


<p>More formally:</p>

<pre><code>Δpop = hs₁₁ * (1-ur₁₁) * Δdw - hs₁₁ * dw₁₆ * Δur +  hh₁₆ * Δhs
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>hs₁₁=pop₁₁/hh₁₁</code> is the household size in 2011 as computed by dividing the population by the number of households,
<code>ur₁₁</code> is the rate of unoccupied dwellings in 2011, <code>dw₁₆</code> is the number of dwellings in 2016 and <code>hh₁₆</code> is the number of households in 2016.</p>

<p>It is simple algebra to check that the identity holds.</p>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/596"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/van_pop_comp.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
The first term gives the contribution to population growth due to the growth in dwellings, assuming that household size and the rate of unoccupied dwellings
are unchanged from 2011.</p>

<p>The second term give the population growth due to the change in the rate of unoccupied dwellings and the third term gives the
population growth due to a change in household size.</p>

<p>Great, all that&rsquo;s left to do is to type the formula into CensusMapper and graph the relative contribution of each of these terms. To make this work
we will have to make due with using only the magnitude of each term, but we can visualize the sign in the bar graph widget when
we hover over an area.</p>

<p>This makes it very easy to compare different areas and see how the different components contribute to the change in
population in each area.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At CensusMapper, we have come a long way from first <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/06/23/vancouver-2011-census-data-on-housing/">dabbling in census data</a> to
building out a <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/09/28/census-mapper/">platform to map data Canada wide</a>, adding
the ability to <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/10/24/census-drilldown/">easily drill down into individual census regions</a>,
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/27/canvas-vs-svg/">improving mapping efficiency</a>, adding the ability to
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/04/20/tod-mode-share/">automatically populate custom geographic data with census variables</a>
and <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/05/02/census-week/">adding older census data</a>.</p>

<p>We believe all of these are comparatively small steps compared to the opening up of map making capabilities for everyone
that we are rolling out today. Free to use, free of charge. Statistic Canada <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/reference/licence-eng">opened up census data</a>
for anyone to use, but the sheer volume of available data and complexities of mapping geographic data has kept this
inaccessible to many.</p>

<p>By opening up basic map making capabilities to everyone we are putting the liberating that data from depth of spreadsheets and
database servers and opening it up to everyone. One map at a time.  Read on for tips and tricks or head right on over
to <a href="https://censusmapper.ca" class="btn btn-primary">Censusmapper</a> to make your first CensusMapper map!</p>

<h3>Simple Maps</h3>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/make_a_map.png"  style="width:30%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
To make your own map, start by choosing &ldquo;Start New 2011 Map&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Make a Map&rdquo; menu. If you are planning on saving
and sharing your map you should log in or create an account first, but you can play with mapping census data without an account.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/signin.png"  style="width:25%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
We tried to make logging in super simple by providing oAuth signup with popular providers, but you can also go the old
fashioned way and create an account manually by providing username (email) and custom password.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/census_variables_menu.png"  style="width:30%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
To start your new map, navigate down to the census variable picker at the bottom of the sidebar. Click the bars
to expand or collapse them. Once you found a variable you want to map, click
the &lsquo;globe&rsquo; icon and select how you want to map the variable.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/map_variable.png"  style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
Depending on what variable you choose you have the option to map simply map the variable, in this case the total number
of people that are married or living with a common law partner, or map the variable as a percentage of a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; variable,
so in this case map the percentage of people that are married or living with a common law partner out of all people 15 years
or over. If in doubt what the variables mean, head over to the
<a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/98-301-X2011001-eng.pdf">Census Dictionary</a>
to look up the definitions.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/finished_map_1.png"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
Once you press the button CensusMapper will do it&rsquo;s magic and map the data for you. Zoom pan and use the search bar to expore
the data across different regions and geographic aggregation levels in Canada. You may want to edit the automatically
generated map label to make it more concise.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/finished_map_2.png"  style="width:30%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
To style your map you can select the &ldquo;Colors&rdquo; option in the orange map editor menu in the sidebar.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/finished_map_3.png"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
There you can style your map by selecting a custom color scheme and fine tune your domain cutoffs.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/finished_map_4.png"  style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
If you were signed in you could now select the &ldquo;Save Map&rdquo; option from the map editor menu and add a map title and a map
description. Map descriptions can be styled in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>.</p>

<p>Maps can tell many different stories, use the map description to give some background and rational for your
map. A good map story might link to different views of the map to support the story telling. You can use the &ldquo;Paste link
to current view into description&rdquo; button to link to different map views. You can also link to different CensusMapper maps
to create deeply integrated map stories. Rich map stories can provide powerful insights into our communities.</p>

<p>If you want to share your map with others, make sure you set the map visibility from &ldquo;Private&rdquo; to &ldquo;Published&rdquo;. Otherwise
others will get an &ldquo;access denied&rdquo; message when they attempt to view the map. Published maps will automatically appear on
the extended map list, so please take some time and write appropriate descriptions that others can enjoy them.</p>

<p>Head on over to <a href="https://censusmapper.ca" class="btn btn-primary">Censusmapper</a> to get started.</p>

<h3>Advanced Maps</h3>

<p>The ability to quickly map any census variable is quite liberating. At the same time it is also restrictive. Imagine
all the things that could be mapped if you could combine census variables in other ways. And CensusMapper has that
capability to dynamically weave a number of census variables into a function to be mapped. But with that comes another
level of complexity and potential pitfalls that, at the moment, prevents us from opening this up to the general public.</p>

<p>At the same time, we are still trying to figure out the overall funding model at CensusMapper. We believe that we have
plenty of value in our advanced mapping capabilities, as well as in our ability to
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/04/20/tod-mode-share/">automatically populate custom geographic data with census variables</a>
and our backend data analysis capabilities to focus on paid products that allows us to open up the Simple Map model
for everyone for free. At CensusMapper, we love open data. And with time as we refine our funding model we may open up
more advanced mapping capabilities to put more data into the palm of everyone&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<h3>Our Worries</h3>

<p>We are also a bit worried about how CensusMapper will be used. The internet has the ability to turn the most beautiful
thing into something ugly, and we are hoping that mappers will use the tool responsibly and make meaningful maps that
tell a story, instead of vanity maps or maps meant to isolate or smear specific groups of people. If we feel that the
tool is being abused we might have to enforce a real name policy or partially close down CensusMapper. Please map responsibly.</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>

<p>If you find any, let us know. The tool should work well on Mac using Chrome, Safari or Firefox and should work reasonably
well on Windows with Chrome and Firefox. iPad, iPhone and modern Android should also work well. Please contact us if you find
anything not working properly.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/05/02/census-week/"/>
    <updated>2016-05-02T11:07:07-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/05/02/census-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/census.jpg"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
At CensusMapper we are super excited about Census Week 2016. Data is increasingly getting incorporated into local and
regional decision making. At CensusMapper we have been working to facilitate this by making this wealth of information
more accessible to everyone. To celebrate Census Week 2016 we have updated CensusMapper with 2006 census data for easy
comparisons with the 2011 data. And we have given CensusMapper a face lift by adding a histogram widget that interacts
with the mapping data. Watch for more exciting updates this week or read on for a sneak peak!</p>

<h3>2006 Census</h3>

<p><a href="http://http://censusmapper.ca/maps/37" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/affordability2011.png"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
<a href="http://http://censusmapper.ca/maps/293" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/affordability2006.png"  style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
We re-worked the backend to make it easy to add and map older censuses. And of course the 2016 census, once it becomes
available. At the first step, this allows side-by-side comparisons between different census years through our map-based
interface. As we explore this further we will add better ways to simultaneously browse two difference censuses, and we
will add a way to map data from two censuses on one the same map. Apart from some technical challenges that we know how
to handle, this also presents challenges when directly comparing the long form census to the 2011 NHS, which had different
collection methods that introduced biases that can be of the same magnitude as the changes one may want to measure.</p>

<h3>Widgets</h3>

<p>At CensusMapper we are all about interaction. We love exploring data visually, and our dynamic zoomable maps make browsing
census data very easy. But the maps are just scratching the surface. Often it is also usefuly to view a simple graph. That&rsquo;s
where the graph widgets come in, the first of which is the histogram that dynamically shows a histogram of the data visible
in the current map view.
<a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/76" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/animated_rent.gif" style="margin:10px;"></a></p>

<p>And of course the widget is fully linked with the map. Hover over a map region, and it will show where the mapped value fits into
histogram. Pan and zoom and the histogram updates automatically. The other way around, hover over a histogram bin and the
corresponding regions on the map get highlighted. That makes exploring the data so much easier.</p>

<h3>Make your own maps</h3>

<p>We will roll out basic map making capabilities for everyone later this week. How will this work? Census data is huge, so
it won&rsquo;t go completely without pain. But we try to make it as easy as possible. Once the new &ldquo;Make a Map&rdquo; option becomes
available you can browse through the list of census variables and simply select which one you want to map. You will have
the option to map the value or, if it makes sense, the value as a percentage of a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; variable.
<a href="http://censusmapper.ca" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/animated_simple.gif" style="margin:10px;"></a></p>

<p>A click of the mouse and you have a new map. Head over to the colour scheme picker and select the colour cutoffs to customize it.
You can even log in and save the map and write your own map story for the side bar, so that you can share and interactive
version of your map online. We can&rsquo;t wait getting census data into everyone&rsquo;s hands!</p>
