    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At CensusMapper, we have come a long way from first <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/06/23/vancouver-2011-census-data-on-housing/">dabbling in census data</a> to
building out a <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/09/28/census-mapper/">platform to map data Canada wide</a>, adding
the ability to <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/10/24/census-drilldown/">easily drill down into individual census regions</a>,
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/27/canvas-vs-svg/">improving mapping efficiency</a>, adding the ability to
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/04/20/tod-mode-share/">automatically populate custom geographic data with census variables</a>
and <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/05/02/census-week/">adding older census data</a>.</p>

<p>We believe all of these are comparatively small steps compared to the opening up of map making capabilities for everyone
that we are rolling out today. Free to use, free of charge. Statistic Canada <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/reference/licence-eng">opened up census data</a>
for anyone to use, but the sheer volume of available data and complexities of mapping geographic data has kept this
inaccessible to many.</p>

<p>By opening up basic map making capabilities to everyone we are putting the liberating that data from depth of spreadsheets and
database servers and opening it up to everyone. One map at a time.  Read on for tips and tricks or head right on over
to <a href="https://censusmapper.ca" class="btn btn-primary">Censusmapper</a> to make your first CensusMapper map!</p>

<h3>Simple Maps</h3>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/make_a_map.png"  style="width:30%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
To make your own map, start by choosing &ldquo;Start New 2011 Map&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Make a Map&rdquo; menu. If you are planning on saving
and sharing your map you should log in or create an account first, but you can play with mapping census data without an account.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/signin.png"  style="width:25%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
We tried to make logging in super simple by providing oAuth signup with popular providers, but you can also go the old
fashioned way and create an account manually by providing username (email) and custom password.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/census_variables_menu.png"  style="width:30%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
To start your new map, navigate down to the census variable picker at the bottom of the sidebar. Click the bars
to expand or collapse them. Once you found a variable you want to map, click
the &lsquo;globe&rsquo; icon and select how you want to map the variable.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/map_variable.png"  style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
Depending on what variable you choose you have the option to map simply map the variable, in this case the total number
of people that are married or living with a common law partner, or map the variable as a percentage of a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; variable,
so in this case map the percentage of people that are married or living with a common law partner out of all people 15 years
or over. If in doubt what the variables mean, head over to the
<a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/98-301-X2011001-eng.pdf">Census Dictionary</a>
to look up the definitions.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/finished_map_1.png"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
Once you press the button CensusMapper will do it&rsquo;s magic and map the data for you. Zoom pan and use the search bar to expore
the data across different regions and geographic aggregation levels in Canada. You may want to edit the automatically
generated map label to make it more concise.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/finished_map_2.png"  style="width:30%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
To style your map you can select the &ldquo;Colors&rdquo; option in the orange map editor menu in the sidebar.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/finished_map_3.png"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
There you can style your map by selecting a custom color scheme and fine tune your domain cutoffs.</p>

<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/finished_map_4.png"  style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
If you were signed in you could now select the &ldquo;Save Map&rdquo; option from the map editor menu and add a map title and a map
description. Map descriptions can be styled in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>.</p>

<p>Maps can tell many different stories, use the map description to give some background and rational for your
map. A good map story might link to different views of the map to support the story telling. You can use the &ldquo;Paste link
to current view into description&rdquo; button to link to different map views. You can also link to different CensusMapper maps
to create deeply integrated map stories. Rich map stories can provide powerful insights into our communities.</p>

<p>If you want to share your map with others, make sure you set the map visibility from &ldquo;Private&rdquo; to &ldquo;Published&rdquo;. Otherwise
others will get an &ldquo;access denied&rdquo; message when they attempt to view the map. Published maps will automatically appear on
the extended map list, so please take some time and write appropriate descriptions that others can enjoy them.</p>

<p>Head on over to <a href="https://censusmapper.ca" class="btn btn-primary">Censusmapper</a> to get started.</p>

<h3>Advanced Maps</h3>

<p>The ability to quickly map any census variable is quite liberating. At the same time it is also restrictive. Imagine
all the things that could be mapped if you could combine census variables in other ways. And CensusMapper has that
capability to dynamically weave a number of census variables into a function to be mapped. But with that comes another
level of complexity and potential pitfalls that, at the moment, prevents us from opening this up to the general public.</p>

<p>At the same time, we are still trying to figure out the overall funding model at CensusMapper. We believe that we have
plenty of value in our advanced mapping capabilities, as well as in our ability to
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/04/20/tod-mode-share/">automatically populate custom geographic data with census variables</a>
and our backend data analysis capabilities to focus on paid products that allows us to open up the Simple Map model
for everyone for free. At CensusMapper, we love open data. And with time as we refine our funding model we may open up
more advanced mapping capabilities to put more data into the palm of everyone&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<h3>Our Worries</h3>

<p>We are also a bit worried about how CensusMapper will be used. The internet has the ability to turn the most beautiful
thing into something ugly, and we are hoping that mappers will use the tool responsibly and make meaningful maps that
tell a story, instead of vanity maps or maps meant to isolate or smear specific groups of people. If we feel that the
tool is being abused we might have to enforce a real name policy or partially close down CensusMapper. Please map responsibly.</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>

<p>If you find any, let us know. The tool should work well on Mac using Chrome, Safari or Firefox and should work reasonably
well on Windows with Chrome and Firefox. iPad, iPhone and modern Android should also work well. Please contact us if you find
anything not working properly.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/05/02/census-week/"/>
    <updated>2016-05-02T11:07:07-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/05/02/census-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/census.jpg"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
At CensusMapper we are super excited about Census Week 2016. Data is increasingly getting incorporated into local and
regional decision making. At CensusMapper we have been working to facilitate this by making this wealth of information
more accessible to everyone. To celebrate Census Week 2016 we have updated CensusMapper with 2006 census data for easy
comparisons with the 2011 data. And we have given CensusMapper a face lift by adding a histogram widget that interacts
with the mapping data. Watch for more exciting updates this week or read on for a sneak peak!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>2006 Census</h3>

<p><a href="http://http://censusmapper.ca/maps/37" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/affordability2011.png"  style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
<a href="http://http://censusmapper.ca/maps/293" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/affordability2006.png"  style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
We re-worked the backend to make it easy to add and map older censuses. And of course the 2016 census, once it becomes
available. At the first step, this allows side-by-side comparisons between different census years through our map-based
interface. As we explore this further we will add better ways to simultaneously browse two difference censuses, and we
will add a way to map data from two censuses on one the same map. Apart from some technical challenges that we know how
to handle, this also presents challenges when directly comparing the long form census to the 2011 NHS, which had different
collection methods that introduced biases that can be of the same magnitude as the changes one may want to measure.</p>

<h3>Widgets</h3>

<p>At CensusMapper we are all about interaction. We love exploring data visually, and our dynamic zoomable maps make browsing
census data very easy. But the maps are just scratching the surface. Often it is also usefuly to view a simple graph. That&rsquo;s
where the graph widgets come in, the first of which is the histogram that dynamically shows a histogram of the data visible
in the current map view.
<a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/76" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/animated_rent.gif" style="margin:10px;"></a></p>

<p>And of course the widget is fully linked with the map. Hover over a map region, and it will show where the mapped value fits into
histogram. Pan and zoom and the histogram updates automatically. The other way around, hover over a histogram bin and the
corresponding regions on the map get highlighted. That makes exploring the data so much easier.</p>

<h3>Make your own maps</h3>

<p>We will roll out basic map making capabilities for everyone later this week. How will this work? Census data is huge, so
it won&rsquo;t go completely without pain. But we try to make it as easy as possible. Once the new &ldquo;Make a Map&rdquo; option becomes
available you can browse through the list of census variables and simply select which one you want to map. You will have
the option to map the value or, if it makes sense, the value as a percentage of a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; variable.
<a href="http://censusmapper.ca" target="_blank"><img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/animated_simple.gif" style="margin:10px;"></a></p>

<p>A click of the mouse and you have a new map. Head over to the colour scheme picker and select the colour cutoffs to customize it.
You can even log in and save the map and write your own map story for the side bar, so that you can share and interactive
version of your map online. We can&rsquo;t wait getting census data into everyone&rsquo;s hands!</p>

<script>
function resetImages(){
    $('img').each(function(img){
        imgsrc = $(img).attr('src');
        if (imgsrc.slice(imgsrc.length-4)=='.gif') {
            $(img).attr('src', '');
            $(img).attr('src', imgsrc);
            
        }
    });
    setTimeout(function(){
        resetImages();
    },25000);
}
setTimeout(function(){
    resetImages();
},25000);

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/27/canvas-vs-svg/"/>
    <updated>2015-12-27T15:53:02-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/12/27/canvas-vs-svg</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>CensusMapper Behind the Scenes</h4>

<p>The idea behind <a href="https://censusmapper.ca">CensusMapper</a> is that it takes away all the technical barriers to dealing with census data. So how does
CensusMapper work behind the scenes?</p>

<h4>CensusMapper Data Workflow</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>The general setup is quite simple. We use the lean javascript open mapping platform <a href="http://leafletjs.com">leaflet</a>
as the base for mapping information. Leaflet handles the logic of dealing with zoom and pan and keeping track of the
geographic boundaries that should be mapped. That information gets then passed on to the CensusMapper servers.</p>

<p>CensusMapper will then send the appropriate census geographic polygons to the browser for leaflet to display. Once the
geographic data is available for mapping, some custom code checks what kind of information the user wants to display and
requests the census data required to make the map. The census information is then assembled on the server, sent down
and attached to the polygons and drawn
on the browser window within leaflet. This two-tier process allows the highly dynamic mapping in CensusMapper where the
data-heavy geographic polygons are kept separately thus can be cached and re-used.</p>

<h4>Drawing Census Data</h4>

<p>There are a number of ways how we can display census data in the browser. At CensusMapper we have played with three
different technologies to map data that vary in performance and browser support. They all have in common that they
won&rsquo;t run on Internet Explorer 8 or earlier, but we have just about reached the point in time where it is acceptable to
ignore IE8- in products meant for the &ldquo;general internet audience&rdquo;.</p>

<h5>SVG</h5>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> is what our maps have been using so far. SVGs are fairly high level, which means it&rsquo;s very little work
to implement and map information. One simply passes a polygon to the browser, tells it how to color it, and the browser
takes care of the rest. SVG elements can easily be styled via CSS, so there is essentially no work involved to deal with
highlight on hover, scaling for retina displays, patterns for census data quality flags, etc. We use
<a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3">d3.js</a> to attach the geographic and census data right to the SVG elements for easy
manipulation.</p>

<p>While mapping data this way is very easy, for CensusMapper there are two problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>We are restricted in how we can display information by the capabilities of SVG.</li>
<li>SVG rendering is done by the browser, and not all browsers are equal. Most importantly, SVG rendering in Internet
Explorer is excruciatingly slow. So slow, that CensusMapper becomes essentially useless within Internet Explorer. We
felt compelled to add a warning messeage that displayed when people opened CensusMapper with Internet Explorer. And
when you do that, that&rsquo;s a sure sign that your app has a serious problem.
<img src="/images/chrome.png" alt="Browser Warning" />
So how to get around those issues? Enter Canvas.</li>
</ol>


<h5>Canvas</h5>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">Canvas</a> offers a way to draw images in a browser. Unlike SVG, the drawing has to be done &ldquo;by hand&rdquo;. And the result is just
an image, with no clear way to tell where it came from. There is no way to attach any information to individual
structures drawn on a canvas. All the logic for highlight on hover, figuring out what data is associated with the mouse
position, dealing with retina displays, etc. needs to be added by hand.</p>

<p>On the upside, a good canvas implementation is a lot faster than SVG. And it opens the door to changes in how the data
is handled that bring additional performance improvements. In particular, we can now chop up census polygons and render
the pieces separately, greatly cutting down on the size of the downloaded data, as well as the complexity of the
polygons that get rendered. And the performance improvements are noticeable across all browsers and platforms.</p>

<p>At the end of the day it is actually not that much work and we flipped the switch on this just before the Christmas
break. CensusMapper is now running using canvas instead SVG for
the main maps. We
kept the look and feel the same, so unless you dig into the code you won&rsquo;t notice the difference.
Some parts of CensusMapper still utilized SVGs, like the d3-based
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/10/24/census-drilldown/">Census Wheel</a>.</p>

<h5>WebGL</h5>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a> also draws on a canvas element, but the work is offloaded onto the GPU (graphics processor) giving enormous
speed improvements. Regular canvas rendering is fast enough for our purposes, but with WebGL we can do more complex
renderings that previously we could not even dream of: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">Shaders</a>
and Interactive 3D data maps. We had previously
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/census3">toyed with 3D data visualization</a> to explore Vancouver&rsquo;s household density in 3D using Three.js,
but did not pursue this further because of the complexities of writing code for navigating a Canada-wide map. Then we came
across the super-customizable 3D open mapping platform built by <a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram/">Mapzen</a>, and that
suddenly made it extremely easy to do interactive 3D data mapping live in the browser. A quick test
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/vancouver_lidar/map">using Vancouver&rsquo;s open LIDAR generated building height data</a> showed how easy Mapzen&rsquo;s
tangram engine is to use.</p>

<p>After digging deeper into tangram, and with help from the friendly people at Mapzen, we figured out a way to fit
CensusMapper&rsquo;s two-stage data workflow into tangram&rsquo;s mapping engine. The result are real-time 3D maps where height
and color of each geographic area can be independently (and dynamically) controlled. Here is an example where mouseover
trigged the area west of Coal Harbor to &lsquo;pop up&rsquo;.
<img src="/images/webGL.jpg" alt="webGL" /></p>

<p>At the same time we gain the ability to easily pull in all kinds of other data and map it. On our canvas or svg maps we
added regular image tiles, either a road and label&rsquo;s overlay or a base map (which then requires opacity to be added to
the census data that is mapped on top of that) as orientation aid. Short of baking our own image tiles we have very
little control over the look and feel of this. With Mapzen&rsquo;s tangram we can very easily pick and style individual
geographic objects from Mapzen&rsquo;s OSM vector tile server, resulting in crisp and clear maps. In the above example we
decide dynamically what level of roads to render, how to style them, what labels to display and we also added bodies of
water, where we filter by size depending on the zoom level.</p>

<p>At this stage it is still an ongoing project to get this production-ready. One obvious obstacle is that WebGL browser
support is still lagging. And on top of that it also requires updated graphics card drivers, which is a big problem on
windows machines that are already a couple of years old. So for now we still need to have a plain canvas or svg fallback.</p>

<p>And then there are the details that need to get worked out. 3D maps sounds great, but it will take us some time to figure
out how to best utilize this in thematic maps. But even without utilizing 3D capabilities, the dynamic shaders and increased
rendering performance are already pushing the boundary of what&rsquo;s possible in web maps.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Census Drilldown]]></title>
    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/10/24/census-drilldown/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-24T20:45:16-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/10/24/census-drilldown</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Next steps in CensusMapper</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">Census Mapper Project</a> is moving along slowly, public beta unearthed some bugs and we gathered
feedback (thanks to everyone reporting back!). There are still a couple of steps that need to be taken care of before
we can unleash the full map making power to all users. We feel that the complexity of census data requires more guidance
than the current map making system is providing. Anyone who does not mind getting there hands dirty and having to look
up census variable definitions by themselves when making maps is welcome to contact us and we will hook you up with a
beta mapmaking account.</p>

<p>In the meantime we added one important feature to the CensusMapper.</p>

<h5>Content Drilldown</h5>

<p>CensusMapper is a great way to explore single census variables (or a single function built out of census variables)
across many geographic regions and aggregation levels. But sometimes we would like to do the opposite: Drill down into
a specific census region and explore other census variables. We have now added an easy way to do this. To access it
simply select the &ldquo;more&rdquo; button in the basic popup when you select a census region. This brings up the <em>census wheel</em>,
which is our way to navigate through census data.
<img src="/images/wheel.png" alt="Census Wheel" /></p>

<p>Try it out right away on <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">CensusMapper</a> or read on for details on how this works.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are almost 4,000 census variables available, right now we do not offer to split up by gender, which reduces the
available variables to 1,429. To further simplify things we throw out all variables with zero values for the give
geographic area, still leaving a
sizeable number of variables to browse through.
<img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/mother_tounge.png" alt="Mother Tounge" style="max-width:400px;margin-right:15px;margin-top:10px;" align="left"/>
Each arc in the census wheel represents a variable, or a category of
variables. Selecting an arc will zoom into that arc and turn it into the &ldquo;center&rdquo; of the wheel, collapsing all other
components. That&rsquo;s the content <em>drilldown</em> process. Once it makes sense to display data as proportions, we switch to the
<em>proportional view</em> which shows the data as hierarchical pie chart.</p>

<p>This gives a visual representation of the proportions of each of the variables. Hovering (or touching) an arc will
display more detailed information, selecting one will drill down further. To reverse that process either select the
center or us the <em>content breadcrumbs</em> at the top that were created during the drilldown process.</p>

<h5>Data Problems</h5>

<p>Census data is messy. Now that all census data for each region is generally accessible in CensusMapper we need to
explain some of the inherent data problems.</p>

<h6>Rounding</h6>

<p>Census Canada will <a href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/help-aide/N2.cfm?Lang=E">round</a>
(almost) all data to preserve anonymity and don&rsquo;t create false impressions of accuracy that
the data does not achieve. Data is generally reported in increments of 5, rounding includes randomness to preserve
anonymity. The value of the measured value
is <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/DQ-QD/conf-eng.cfm">within 4</a> of the reported one. And
remember that even the measured variable is only an estimate of the actual value of the variable.
Rounding may lead to situations where, for example, the sum of all people listed
by age bracket will not add up to the total number of people. Generally, this difference will be small and we ignore it
in our visualization.</p>

<h6>Omitted Data</h6>

<p>Census Canada will at times not report data. This could be due to very low return rates or other problems that make data
so unreliable that it is better not reported at all. Or it could be that releasing the information could compromize
the anonymity of the census data for some people in that area. The latter can take
the form of Census Canada not reporting any data for the region, or Census Canada zeroing out specific variables that
&ldquo;are too low to be reported&rdquo;.
<img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/unaccounted.png" alt="Unaccounted" style="max-width:400px;margin-left:15px;margin-top:10px;" align="right"/>
We have not been able to find clear guidelines how the &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo; works, but often this will leave
detectable traces in the data. Looking at the example in the image, looking at &ldquo;Mode of Transport&rdquo; to work only
&ldquo;Driving&rdquo; has non-zero values, the
other options &ldquo;Passenger&rdquo;, &ldquo;Transit&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bike&rdquo;, &ldquo;Walk&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other&rdquo; are all zero. There were 160 people getting to work,
115 are listed as &ldquo;Driver&rdquo;, leaving 45 unaccounted for. This is outside of the range that could be explained by the
rounding of variables. We alert the user by adding in
a grey area for the missing 45. This also ensures that the visual representation remains accurate.</p>

<h6>Multiple Responses</h6>

<p>Some census questions allow for multiple responses. For exaple &ldquo;Language Spoken Most Often At Home&rdquo;. In this particular
case the census variable breaks out single responses and multiple responses and is very transparent to the user. In
other cases, for example &ldquo;Ethnicity&rdquo;, single and multiple responses are not reported separately but responses are all
added up. This leads to the sum of lower level variables being higher than the base variable. We alert the user to this
by overlaying small white dots on the base variable.
<img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/multiple_responses.png" alt="Multiple Responses" style="max-width:400px;margin-right:15px;margin-top:10px;" align="left"/>
In this particular case the total for for &ldquo;Ethnic Origin&rdquo; was 12,140 people. But there were 1,430 more responses at the
next level, so up to 1,430 people had given multiple responses to this question listing more than one of the aggregate
(mostly continent level) origins, some possibly listing more than two. The same patter repeats at different ethnic
origin aggregation
levels, for example 2,565 people claimed at least one of the &ldquo;British Island origins&rdquo;, but many listed more than one
resulting in the sum of the individual regions with the British Islands exceeding the British Island count by 1,445.
Again, we alert the user by overlaying dots over the &ldquo;British Island origins&rdquo; arc. Hovering over the arg will display
the exact numbers of the &ldquo;overcounting&rdquo; due to multiple responses.</p>

<p>In these cases where mulitple repsonses are not broken out the dots will aler the user that the proportional
representation in the hierarchical pie chart does not represent proportions out of a total given by the value of the
variable at the centre (or lower level), but as a proportion of all responses which exceeds the value of the
lower level variable.</p>

<h6>Basic Census</h6>

<p>The Basic Census is generally speaking quite reliable, every single person is required to fill it
out and return rates are generally above 95%. Serious problems will only occur if response rates are very low. We alert
the user by shading geographic regions is this has been the case.</p>

<h6>NHS</h6>

<p>The National Household Survey is quite different in nature, it was only
sent out to a smaller portion (~30%) of society and return rates were much lower (~69%). Even with 100% return rates
there are likely to be geographic regions where the results severely misrepresent reality in that region due to sampling
bias. For each region that bias is small, but the probability for bias grows as the number of people in the geographic
region declines. So this is mostly a problem for Dissemination Areas. But even there, the probability of severe sampling
bias in each region is small, but there are many regions and the probability that some of these regions suffer from
sever sampling bias is quite large.</p>

<p>On top of this basic statistical sampling bias, we also have self selection bias due to some deomgraphics being more
likely to return the survey than others. This bias is a product of the decision of scrapping the madatory
&lsquo;long form census&rsquo; and replacing it with the voluntary NHS. The return rates can give some indication of the
likelyhood of self-selection
bias, we shade regions with a non-return rate lower than 50%, the cutoff Census Canada set for reliability of the NHS.
It is especially problematic when trying to detect change in variables (for example poverty) from one census to another
as the differences in the variable over time are often small and similar in magnitude to possible self-selection bias.</p>

<p>The 50% cutoff we highlight in CensusMapper is just a guideline, the exact return rates are displayed on hover or when
selecting regions and should always to be taken into
account when interpreting results,
especially at the Dissemination Area level.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h5>We are excited to announce CensusMapper public beta launch!</h5>

<p>The project on mapping census data for Canada is entering the next stage. We are now mapping 3875 different
variables from the 2011 census, or any combination of them, across 67215 geographic regions covering all of Canada.</p>

<p>We are opening up the <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">Census Mapper</a> to a limited public beta. Limited means that anyone
can view maps created in CensusMapper, but we are only opening up the map creation tools to selected beta users.</p>

<p>Be aware that the web app makes use of modern web technology and renders large amount of data. It will only work on
modern browsers, best viewed in Chrome or Safari. Firefox works ok, Internet Explorer might grind to a halt and should be avoided.</p>

<p><a href="http://censusmapper.ca"><img src="/images/map-tools.jpg" alt="CenusMap Mapmaker" /></a></p>

<p>We are a little restrictive on creating maps right now for the simple reason that census data is somewhat tricky to
understand and at this point we don&rsquo;t have a comprehensive guide explaining all the variables and warning against many
of the pitfalls. We are planning to slowly integrate this and open up the map creation tools to the general public.</p>

<h3>Why CensusMapper?</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>Census Canada data is extremely rich and useful in many cirumstances, but it is not being widely used. There are many
reasons for this, the somewhat unmanageable amount of data being one of them, the difficulty of accessing and standardizing
the in principle freely available datasets is another.</p>

<p>Census data is inherently geographic in nature, working with the data without proper visualization tools can be challenging
too. And even for people that have good access to the data and that are well-versed in mapping geographic data, it can
still take quite a bit of time to generate maps visualizing the data. CensusMapper greatly speeds up this process by
allowing straightforward mapping of any function derived from census variables through all geographic aggregation levels
Canada wide.</p>

<h3>Storytelling</h3>

<p>Census mapper does more than just mapping census data. It is designed as a storytelling tool. Few maps are so crisp and
clear that they are self-explanatory. A map of population density might fall into that category. But most census variables
are sufficiently complex that maps derived from them warrant narration. We think of CensusMapper as a storytelling tool
that allows &lsquo;readers&rsquo; of the map to interact with it, zoom in, zoom out, pan around, and jump to other maps linked in the
story provided by the mapmaker.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<p>There are many ways to expand on this. On the map creation side we can offer more diverse coloring tools, allowing user
input and user defined map locations to be used in the mapping function, add data from previous census. We could allow
limited upload of user data to be integrated with census data, statistical and spacial analysis tools, custom mapping projects.</p>
