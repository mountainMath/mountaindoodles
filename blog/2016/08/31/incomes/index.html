<div class="entry-content"><p>The news media has an extraordinarily difficult time with income data. And that&rsquo;s only partially the media&rsquo;s fault.
In general, income data is a funny beast. So I decided to give a quick overview over income data that&rsquo;s available through
Statistics Canada. To make things a little more concrete I focused on Vancouver as an example, but everything applies
equally well to any other area in Canada.</p>

<p>Most journalists I talked to care about accurate and relevant statements. If that&rsquo;s you, you will need to keep reading
and dive down the slightly wonkish income rabbit hole.</p>

<p>For those that don&rsquo;t really care, I made a
<em>quotable random income generator</em>. Just hit the &ldquo;generate&rdquo; button copy &amp; paste the result and link this post as source.
(Use at own risk!)</p>

<p>The income numbers don&rsquo;t fit the story? No problem, just play again until you get something you like!</p>

<h3>Geographic Regions</h3>

<p>The first thing to do when quoting income numbers of any sort is to decide what region to use. Seems straight forward
enough, but in reality <a href="https://twitter.com/vb_jens/status/744407354867736576">hardly ever done</a>. In the Vancouver
context, it simply comes down to deciding if one wants to
report on income for the City of Vancouver or Metro Vancouver. Both are frequently referred to as just &ldquo;Vancouver&rdquo;. Which
is just fine as long as it is clear from the context which region we are talking about. And more importantly, whatever
the income is compared to (e.g. housing price data) are taken for the same region.</p>

<h3>Base Demographics</h3>

<p>Next we have to choose a base demographic we are interested in, choose which income distribution is relevant for our context.
In some cases this choice is obvious. If we are writing a story on lone parents in the City of Vancouver, we would want
to look at the income distribution of lone parent households. If we are looking at the development of wages, we should
consider individual incomes. For a story on consumer spending we may want to look at after-tax income.</p>

<p>We may also be interested in specific type of income, for example only in investment income. Or the net capital gains
and losses. Or pension benefits. Or self-employment income.</p>

<h3>Statistic</h3>

<p>Often we would like to distill everything down to a single number. Typically we would choose the average or median
income from the distribution we are interested in, but we may also choose other statistics, for example the top quintile.
Which one we choose really depends on the story. As a rule of thumb, choose median incomes if you are interested in the
&lsquo;typical&rsquo; person or household. Choose average income if you are interested in the questions relating to the total amount
of money earned in a given area. Income quantiles are great to focus in on certain subgroups of the population.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>Generally we also have to consider the availability of information. The census has very detailed income data in their
standard release that allow us to be very specific about what kind of incomes we are interested in. And if that&rsquo;s not
enough we can pull a custom tabulation to narrow the incomes down to a group we are interested in, for example incomes
of renter households as was done in the <a href="http://rentalhousingindex.ca">rental housing index</a>.</p>

<p>Annual income data is available from CANSIM, but the geography is coarser than in the census. Generally we can only
expect to get annual data for the whole country, provinces, census metropolitan areas or census divisions, but not census
subdivisions (municipalities) or finer geographies.</p>

<h3>Sources and Comparability</h3>

<p>All income data eventually come down to CRA taxfiler data. But the devil is in the details. For the 2006 and 2011
censuses, there was a mixture between self-reporting and cross-referencing of individual level income data with CRA data.
And even self-reported data would again undergo quality control and get somewhat adjusted according to CRA data.</p>

<p>But there are important differences in the data, both on what kind of income is included and also what people are included.</p>

<p>The details are endless, many of them won&rsquo;t matter. Here are a couple to look out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>CANSIM is a comprehensive sample, census data is roughly a 1 in 5 subsample which may lead to sampling bias especially
in small geographies.</li>
<li>CENSUS data is sensitive to non-return bias. Not just no-return bias introduced by the NHS, but also by census undercounts
which, for example, were in the 10% range for the 25 to 29 year old demographic in both the 2006 and 2011 censuses.</li>
<li>CANSIM and the Census have different denominators for reporting average or median incomes. CANSIM reports on all
T1 taxfilers, as well as various family types. Some data can be broken out into age groups at
the 15 and 65 year cutoffs,
whereas Census reports only on people (15 or older) (or families or households) in &ldquo;private households&rdquo; with income greater
than zero.</li>
<li>the definition of &ldquo;private household&rdquo; changed between 2006 and 2011 censuses.</li>
<li>2011 and 2006 censuses differ slightly in what is included as income, for example
<a href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/ref/dict/pop123-eng.cfm">2006 included RRSP withdrawls</a>,
<a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/ref/dict/pop123-eng.cfm">2011 didn&rsquo;t</a> (both include pensions and RRIFs).
2011 includes net capital gains and losses as a percentage of total income in a separate category, 2006 did not
include any information on capital gains.</li>
</ul>


<p>So even when comparing CANSIM income data to census income data for the appropriate year we should expect some differences.
Or comparing 2006 to 2011 income, even if hypothetically an area had identical tax returns, we would still see differences.
Generally speaking, CANSIM average and median income estimates are lower than census estimates as it includes a larger pool
of people that are likely to have lower income.</p>

<h3>Where to get the goods?</h3>

<p><img  src="/images/yvr_income.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
The latest census income numbers are available via <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm">Statistics Canada</a>.
I am biased and prefer the <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/467">CensusMapper</a> interface. For 2011 data, choose any
2011 CensusMapper map, select the geographic
region you are interested in and press the &ldquo;more&rdquo; button on the popup to bring up the &ldquo;census wheel&rdquo;. Then drill into the
&ldquo;income&rdquo; section, the last NHS variable in the widget.</p>

<p>CANSIM has annual data based on taxfiler information for coarser geographies. So you won&rsquo;t be able to get data for the City of Vancouver
or neighbourhoods within the city like with census data, but you can get data for Metro Vancouver. And you can get it for
more recent years. Things get complex very fast there are
<a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a33?themeID=3868&amp;spMode=tables&amp;chunkSize=213">213 CANSIM tables with income data</a></p>

<p>At CensusMapper we are still firmly planning integrate CANSIM data into the CensusMapper interface, but their API refresh got pushed back
to sometime 2018 and we can&rsquo;t justify the extra resources to integrate CANSIM data temporarily using the old API just
to switch it over a year later.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>To conclude this let&rsquo;s go through the motions of how these choices can lead to different stories. Some general choices
what income to use is often pretty obvious. Others are more subtle and a matter of judgement. For simplicity we focus
entirely on the situation in 2010, because that&rsquo;s the last year we have detailed income data for the City of Vancouver
and we also have detailed publicly available single family housing price data.</p>

<p>If we are doing
a story on housing affordability the first starting point is to look at income of (private) households. We may also want
to consider the owner-renter split in the region we are interested in.</p>

<p>Households are as diverse as
dwelling types. If we write a story about single family housing, household income of all households is too broad to be
relevant. For example,
in the city of Vancouver there are about 75,500 single family lots, but 264,573 households. So at most 28% of households
can live in the main house on a single family lot. Taking the median household income makes no sense in this situation.
We need to narrow down the target group. In Calgary on the other hand,
59% of the dwelling stock is single detached (and there are more properties if we count the ones with suites like we
did for Vancouver), so in that case the assumption that the median household is looking to buy a single family home is
more reasonable. Although the median household probably won&rsquo;t be looking to buy the median single family home but a lower-priced one.</p>

<p>So how should we measure the affordability of single family properties? That&rsquo;s not an easy question. A natural choice may
be to focus in on the 151,330 census families in Vancouver. Again, there are more than twice as many candidates as single
family properties. So maybe narrow it down even further an only look at the 88,515 census
families with children at home. Or the 63,790 couple families with children at home. Realistically speaking, even
going with couple families with children at home there just aren&rsquo;t enough single family properties to go around. Unless we
are willing to force out all of the roughly 45% of the occupants of the main house on single family lots that currently only have
1 or 2 people living in there. But overall, couple families with children is probably a better metric for affordability
for single family homes. Others will of course also buy single family homes, but maybe we will be less worried if
they can&rsquo;t afford one.</p>

<p>To complete the example, in 2010 the median single family property cost $848,000 (average $1,133,000) and the median
couple family with children income in private households was $92,068 (average $123,252).
That gives a dwelling value to income ratio of around 9.2, showing that the median single family property is not
affordable for the median couple family with children. By affordable we mean that with a 20% down payment the shelter
costs stay below 30% of pre-tax income, which requires a ratio of at most 6.6 assuming an interest rate of 3% and 25
years amortization.
If we were to more realistically assume that the median income couple family with children were to look to buy a single
family property priced at the 10 percentile level of $606,100 we get a dwelling value to income ratio of 6.6, barely
squeezing in below our affordability cutoff.</p>

<p>Another way to slice the data is to look at the household income distribution. By definition there are 37,750
single family homes more expensive than the median single family home. From the income distribution there are 44,215
households with income over $125,000. Taking $125,000 as our income we get a median dwelling value to income ratio of 6.8.
Only when throwing in some secondary suite rental income can we get to the
&lsquo;barely affordable&rsquo; 6.6 ratio. Adding rental income is double-dipping though, rental income should already be
included in our total income numbers. Assuming secondary suite rental income is correctly reported.</p>

<p>Using the household income instead we would have gotten a ratio of 13.4, which is ridiculously unaffordable. But then
again, the notion that the median household should be able to purchase the median single family property
(or even a low-value single family property) is also ridiculous.</p>

<p>This analysis assumes that all these households are comfortable to max out when buying a home and that there are no other
competing significant financial obligations like heavy student loans. And, just as a reminder, we were looking at 2010.
As of 2015 the price of the median single family home has increased 67%. We don&rsquo;t have 2015 income numbers for the City of
Vancouver (yet), but Couple Family median income for Metro Vancouver has increased 13% between 2010 and 2014, the last
year with available data. Extrapolating out that trend to 2015, and assuming that whatever other income metrics we were
looking at, we get an estimated income increase by 16%. So any affordabiliy ratio is about 1.4 times worse in 2015 compared
to the 2010 ratio. What may have been &lsquo;barely affordable&rsquo; in 2010 is clearly unaffordable in 2015.</p>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/478" target="_blank"><img  src="/images/tenant_and_qualifying.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
Going to 2010 income (mixed with 2011 census housing data), we can take a different look into the data. Many people
have bought into the market when it was cheaper and have lower mortgages to serve, which is
evident when comparing <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/399">running shelter costs to income</a> (which considers tenant as
well as owner households). But if we check <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/465">what portion
of households in each region qualifies to buy the median dwelling in that region</a>, and
especially the ones when we even <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/478">add on the portion of rental households</a>, we
see that 2010 (reported) incomes cannot sustain the census 2011 housing prices even if we assume that all owner households are
willing to stretch themselves to the limits of our affordability definition.</p>
