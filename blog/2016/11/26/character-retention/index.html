<div class="entry-content"><p>Today I went to the City of Vancouver Character Retention open house. It was quite informative, city staff were helpful and knowledgeable,
and the display board and feedback form asked many good questions. But I came away with three grievances:</p>

<ul>
<li>The proposed retention policies hold gentle, ground-oriented density hostage to character retention.</li>
<li>Some of the character retention policy proposals seem to ignore underlying economic drivers.</li>
<li>The effort is entirely focused on RS and excludes RT.</li>
</ul>

<h3>RT</h3>

<p>Lets start with the simple one, the focus on RS and exclusion of RT. This seems to be motivated by the fact that RT already
has character retention guidelines. The way it works is that much of RT is downzoned, with extra density conditional on
character retention. This seems to be the basic blueprint of the proposal for RS, so let&rsquo;s take a close look how this works.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[zone_RT-6]&layer=20&zoom=16&lat=49.2587&lng=-123.1063&mapBase=2" target="_blank"><img  src="/images/rt-6.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
Mount Pleasant gives a good example of what this can look like. In
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[zone_RT-6]&amp;layer=20&amp;zoom=16&amp;lat=49.2587&amp;lng=-123.1063&amp;mapBase=2">RT-6 zoning</a>
we have allowed stratified 4 and 5-plexes on single family lots under the character retention policies. We have
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/08/04/rt/">looked at this before</a>, what this essentially entails is a &ldquo;character home&rdquo;
being gutted down to the studs (in most cases), potentially moved to a corner of the property and a foundation added. Then
the entire house gets build up again and infill added to the back. The whole thing gets sliced up and stratified, resulting
in 4 to 5 family-sized ground-oriented units. In terms of prices, the assessments pegged at July 2015
(which became surprisingly accurate again) pegs single family lots between $1m and $6m (median $1.9m), and units in those
multiplexes between $300k and $1.8m (median $800k).</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[zone_RT-7]&layer=20&zoom=15&lat=49.2636&lng=-123.1706&mapBase=2" target="_blank"><img  src="/images/rt-7.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
This kind of development is great. We need more of that, much more.
But this same model can&rsquo;t be immediately taken and expanded across the city. One look across town to
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[zone_RT-7]&amp;layer=20&amp;zoom=15&amp;lat=49.2636&amp;lng=-123.1706&amp;mapBase=2">RT-7</a>,
where similar guidelines are in place, shows that multi-plexes only appear in the pocket at 16th and Arbutus. That&rsquo;s
mainly because the Mt Pleasant model of character &ldquo;retention&rdquo; requires large lots, and most of RT-7 is on smaller lots
that make the process of &ldquo;retention&rdquo; into multi-plexes according to current city rules unattractive. The rules need to
be amended to take lots size (and other parameters) into account to unlock this kind of development across the city.</p>

<p>This resulted in RT-6 only having 12% of the building stock currently facing high teardown pressure, compared to 34% of
RT-7. In the pocket of RT-7 east of McDonald, where lots are larger and more properties underwent the character retention
process, only 17% of the building stock faces high teardown pressure.</p>

<p>So even if this worked in parts of RT, RT-6 in particular, it does not seem to be &ldquo;working&rdquo; in other parts in the sense
that hardly any properties undergo this process. Take a look at
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[zone_RT,years_2000,nzone_RT-11]&amp;layer=20&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2497&amp;lng=-123.1232&amp;mapBase=2">all the properties that have been built since 2000 in RT</a>,
keyed by whether it was a single family, duplex or multi-plex that got built. We removed RT-11 from the map, it is too
new to be meaningful. It&rsquo;s amazing to me how in some pockets almost no multi-plexes get built. We should try and fine-tune
this process before transplanting it to RS.</p>

<p>RT-11 offers a cautionary tale. Looking at what got <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[zone_RT-11,years_2000]&amp;layer=20&amp;zoom=15&amp;lat=49.2393&amp;lng=-123.0509&amp;mapBase=2">built after 2000</a>
we see lots of single family homes. A huge missed opportunity. If we had upzoned that area a decade earlier we could
have allowed for homes that suit our families much better.</p>

<h3>Hostage Taking</h3>

<p>In my mind, holding gentle, ground-oriented density hostage to character retention is terrible thing to do. Whatever the
question is, downzoning can&rsquo;t be part of the answer any more. Vancouver is starved for gentle, sensible, ground-oriented
family-friendly development.</p>

<p>Originally, when the character retention guidelines for RT were made, this kind of gentle density came in the Trojan horse
of character retention. And even if much of that was faux character, I don&rsquo;t mind. I take that kind of density any way I can.</p>

<p>But we are quite a bit further along now. Unaffordability skyrocketed. Families are starved for housing options.
We need to scale this process up. And just expanding
the area where we deploy it to also cover RS won&rsquo;t do the trick. We average about 10 of those character retention projects
a year. Out of 11k RT properties. If we scale that up to all 68k RS properties, we will increase that number to about 70
a year. Just for perspective to see how inadequate that is, we tear down around 1000 single family homes a year.
And replace them with single family homes.</p>

<p>What we need is a program that brings this type of density to RS and RT independent of the character retention program.
There is not much that is being &ldquo;retained&rdquo; in many of the character retention projects, so let&rsquo;s do away with that
&ldquo;retention&rdquo; pretence. In some
cases just a pillar or two, in many cases at least most of the outside studs. But everything else is brand new, including
all the structural elements. What is &ldquo;retained&rdquo; (or better &ldquo;re-created&rdquo;) is the exterior appearance of a character home. And
if that&rsquo;s what Vancouverites want in return for gentle density, then this can easily be handle in the design review process
that dictates the exterior look of new-builts too.</p>

<p><img  src="/images/4-plex.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
If we value real retention, offer some extra FSR over and above what&rsquo;s being given in Mt Pleasant if there is meaningful
retention. But let&rsquo;s not hold that kind of gentle density hostage to the retention process.
I have yet to find someone who does not like the Mt Pleasant style infill density, like the 4-plex infill pictured here. This kind of development
should be encouraged city wide, also for new-builts. And not taken hostage under the process of (faux) character retention.</p>

<h3>Economics</h3>

<p>Character retention is hard to do. It will need incentives to make it happen. The more the character retention process
can leverage some underlying economic drivers, the more effective it will be.</p>

<p>We ran some analysis on 11 years of property-level assessment data in the City of Vancouver that was made available
through the open data catalogue. The upshot is that the single most important factor that predicts if a building gets
torn down is the (assessed) value of the building alone relative to the total value of the property. We call this
quotient the &ldquo;teardown coefficient&rdquo; and found that if it is below 5%, the building has a 1/6 chance to get torn down
within 8 to 10 years. More details and background on this
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/18/redevelopment/">can be found here</a>, a refinement of this analysis is works in progress.</p>

<p>Currently, 34% of the SFH building stock in Vancouver fall into that category. Often people assume that the risk of a
building getting torn down simply depends on the building age. But the relationship is not that simple as the following graph shows.</p>

<div style="margin:10px 50px;padding:5px;border: 1px solid black;border-radius:5px;">
<div id="graph_sfh" style="height:200px;max-width:640px;" data-url="/data/sfh_age.json"></div>
<div class="legend no-margin"></div>
</div>


<p>The blue denotes properties facing little teardown pressure, the red is for properties with high teardown pressure.
We can see that the pre-1920 building stock holds up reasonably well. In fact, 33% of the pre-1920 building stock with
high teardown risk. For the 1920 to 1935 stock we have 59% of buildings in teardown territory, and for 1935 to 1965
buildings that number jumps to 78%. This makes the particular choice of the character cutoff year 1940 a bit of a head-scratcher.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,teardowns]&layer=100&zoom=13&lat=49.2489&lng=-123.1081&mapBase=2" target="_blank"><img  src="/images/teardowns2.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
This informs the scale of the teardown pressure the building stock of a particular vintage is facing. We can similarly
map the individual properties to understand their geographic distribution. One should note that assessment data, while
unbiased in aggregate, can be quite off when looking at specific buildings. So when mapping for example
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,teardowns]&amp;layer=4">all single family homes with high teardown pressure</a>
it might mis-identify some buildings as teardown candidates, or miss others. However, in aggregate the data will be
quite robust and one can easily see that there are no obvious geographic biases in teardown risk. To quantify some of
this, 31% of eastside SFH vs 39% of westside SFH face high teardown risk.</p>

<p>Understanding the teardown pressure, as well as the geographic distribution and the pressures by vintage, gives an
important baseline to the heritage and the character discussions. Houses far above the 5% threshold face little
teardown pressure, and they need little, if any, policy protection to retain them. On the other hand, for houses
significantly below the teardown cutoff it makes very little economic sense to retain a building, and will require a
lot of effort and policy protection to try and retain them. And even with these protections, there is a good chance
that the building will eventually go or face &ldquo;demolition by neglect&rdquo;.</p>

<p>One example of this is the property at 4755 Belmont Ave, which the city lists as heritage building of primary significance.
<img  src="/images/demo_by_neglect.png" style="width:40%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></p>

<p>Effective retention policies are likely going to aim at the building stock around and somewhat above the teardown
threshold of 5%. Plus select buildings of significant heritage value below the 5% threshold, with the understanding
that these will likely require public investment to make them viable and successfully retain them for the long term.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,years__1935]&layer=110&zoom=13&lat=49.2489&lng=-123.1148&mapBase=2" target="_blank"><img  src="/images/teardown_pressure.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"></a>
With this in mind, and setting the age cutoff to 1935 instead of 1940, we can investigate the existing pre-1935 building
stock by teardown pressure, separating out the stock that faces
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,years_1935,tdc__0.05]&amp;layer=100&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2489&amp;lng=-123.1081&amp;mapBase=2">high teardown pressure</a>
from the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,years__1935,tdc_0.05_0.1]&amp;layer=101&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2489&amp;lng=-123.1081&amp;mapBase=2">stock with moderate teardown pressure</a>
and the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,years__1935,tdc_0.1]&amp;layer=102&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2489&amp;lng=-123.1081&amp;mapBase=2">stock with low teardown pressure</a>.
And we can view <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=[sfh,years__1935]&amp;layer=110&amp;zoom=13&amp;lat=49.2489&amp;lng=-123.1148&amp;mapBase=2">all three at the same time</a>.</p>

<p>Without taking these underlying economic factors into consideration, heritage and character retention policies are
likely to be less effective at retention than they otherwise would be. And have broader adverse effects on buildings
without significant heritage or character merit.</p>

<h3>New Carrots</h3>

<p>If density won&rsquo;t be the main carrot (or a stick) for character retention, than what can pull up the slack? Property taxes is an obvious one.
The owner could be allowed to re-claim property taxes against improvements and maintenance that aim to maintain or
underline the character merit of the home. And these re-claimed taxes become cumulatively payable, with interest, in the
event of demolition. Of course this would raise everyone else&rsquo;s property taxes, but I think that&rsquo;s only fair in return
for the community dictating character-homeowners the exterior look of their home.</p>

<p>The idea behind this is that this aims to directly strengthen the economic viability of the building, thus removing the
economic drivers that favour tearing down the building. And over time accumulating a penalty that dissuades from
tearing down the building.</p>

<p>Density can still be part of the mix, but not in a way that it precludes smart gentle density to be built without
it. The reality is that much of our building stock will go, the economic drivers are just too strong. And we all know that
we should not replace those single family homes with yet another single family home that at best the top 5% income households
can afford. We should allow these houses to be replaced with ground-oriented units a much larger portion of Vancouver
families can afford.</p>

<p>Smarter people than me have probably though about this for quite some time now. I would love to hear more ideas how
character retention can be structured so that it does not get in the way of gentle density for new builts.</p>
