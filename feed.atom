    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here come some general thoughts on bike maps. Not throught through yet, just jotting down some ideas so that I don&rsquo;t
forget and maybe to start a discussion.</p>

<p>Bike enthusiasts, OSM folks and mapping technology wonks read on!</p>

<h4>Why make a new bike map?</h4>

<p>Plainly put, I don&rsquo;t like a lot of the bike maps out there. Time for my little bike map rant:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lots of maps don&rsquo;t accomplish their core mission:
accurately map bike infrastructure. For example, when in real life a bike lane vanishes 100m in front of an intersection
and reappears 100m after the intersection, leaving cyclists exposed right where protection is needed the most, most
bike maps will mark the entire section as having a bike lane.</li>
<li>Most bike maps focus on the wrong issue. They focus on physical infrastructure, as a cyclist I am interested in
cycling comfort level. Can I take my 6 year old along that route? Can I cycle leisurely or will I feel hastened by a
car breathing down my neck? Will I arrive at my destination relaxed or will I be riled up by 3 near misses and 5 drivers
swearing at me? Some of these questions can be answered by mapping infrastructure. A physically separated bike path will
give me the comfort I need to bing my 6 year old and enjoy my ride. But when it comes to &ldquo;bike lane&rdquo; or &ldquo;shared road&rdquo;
designations, I have no idea what it will feel like until I get there.</li>
<li>Most bike maps have not yet made the transition from paper/PDF based maps to clickable and zoomable maps that can be
easily consumed on the go.</li>
</ol>


<h4>How to make a new bike map?</h4>

<p>First let&rsquo;s start with examples of how other have tried to solve these problems. Probably one of the best maps out there
is the <a href="https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/crd-document-library/maps/transportation/bikemap2014-frontback-web.pdf?sfvrsn=8">Capital Regional District Bike Map</a>.
I chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/Burgundavia">Corey</a> who worked for CRD on these maps on how it was done. They collected all the bike infrastructure
in the region by contacting all the municipalities. <img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/victoria.png" style="width:50%;float:left"> Then they meticulously
checked that what the municipalities reported actually existed on the ground.  Consider Fort road on their bike map where they accurately show the bike lane
cutting out. And they added in shortcuts and connections
that the municipalities did not report on, like a short section of footway that may technically require walking the bike
but shortcuts out of a suburban cul-de-sac maze.</p>

<p>Next the CRD map does not only map infrastructure, but color-codes it to show cycling comfort. <img  src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/victoria-legend.png" style="width:50%;float:right">
This gives me a good idea how comfortable the rider will feel. Unfortunately all that complexity starts to make it difficult to
read the bike map.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where technology could come to the rescure. The CRD map is a PDF map and suffers the usual limitations that come
with it. The map cannot adapt to the needs of the reader. So how about moving the map online and letting the user decide
how to display it?</p>

<h4>Bike maps that adapt to the user</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/01/bleak-maps-of-how-cities-look-using-only-their-bike-lanes/">Washington Post Wonkblog</a>
had an excellent feature mapping only the bike infrastructure, nothing else. And for good measure, they removed the
shared streets bike infrastructure. The rational was that in most cases, comfort level on shared street bike routes is really no different from
cycling on a parallel road. Inspired by that I decided <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/04/01/bike-paths/">map Vancouver and a couple of other cities</a>
and I added in some button to allow selectively turning on or off typed of infrastructure.</p>

<iframe src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths.html?fh=50&nh=true" width="50%" height="300"></iframe>


<p>That&rsquo;s getting one step closer to adaptable bike maps, but it is still missing the main point that as a cyclist I am
most interested in comfort level, and infrastructure type is only a proxy for that. And a poor one in many cases.</p>

<h4>Inspiration</h4>

<p>Not convinced we need a new bike map? Let&rsquo;s draw on some local (for me) maps that inspired this effort.</p>

<p>UBC Campus Planning <a href="https://twitter.com/ubc_candcp/status/662027568204357633">keeps tweeting out a bike map</a>
that lists several dangerous roads as &ldquo;designated on street cycling routes&rdquo;, including an unlit divided 4 lane highway
with a posted speed limit of 60km/h and typical traffic speeds significantly exceeding that. And all of that apparently
aimed at people that don&rsquo;t cycle to campus yet but are considering doing so.</p>

<p>TransLink just <a href="http://www.translink.ca/-/media/Documents/cycling/cycling_routes/full_maps/TransLink%20Regional%20Cycling%20Map%20West.pdf">updated their bike map</a>
and marks said highway as &ldquo;recommended by cyclists&rdquo;. The do acknowlege that the road &ldquo;does not have special treatment
for cyclists&rdquo;. So why include it on the map? Filling in the the gaps in the cycling network should happen in real life,
not just on the map.</p>

<p>Even HUB keeps <a href="https://bikehub.ca/about-us/our-positions/ungapthemap">marking Wesbrook Mall north of Agronomy as &ldquo;existing cycling route&rdquo;</a>
when in real life it is everything but that.</p>

<h4>How to make a bike map</h4>

<p>So how should we make a bike map? I was always thinking about setting up my own database and somehow adding and rating
infrastructure. Then <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwarrior">Alex</a> decided to start making a bike
map for the UBC area. And he chose the most straight-forward path: Editing Open Street Map data. That way the edits are
immediately (better: after their map tile refresh cycle) available online, for example on
<a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/">OpenCycleMaps</a>. The map is easily accessible
on the go, it zooms and scrolls. It is missing a &lsquo;locate me&rsquo; button (which is easy to fix). The look and feel is a little
dated. But most importantly, it does not adapt to the user&rsquo;s needs. I can&rsquo;t ask it to display the &ldquo;dad&rsquo;s version&rdquo; of the
cycle network, showing me only pieces that I will be comfortable cycling with my 6 year old.</p>

<p>Technology has moved along since that map was built. A very easy way to solve these issues is to
utilized the awesome tools built by the folks at <a href="https://mapzen.com">Mapzen</a>. Their
<a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram">tangram mapping engine</a> taps into their
<a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles">OSM vector tile service</a> to make flexible mapping of bike data a breeze. And
to top things off, they offer very easy to use and extremely powerful ways to style the map. Only problem: Mapzen&rsquo;s
OSM extracts don&rsquo;t have cycling information. Not a big problem though, we can just pull them out separately and add
them on by hand. Here is an example where only the bike routes near UBC are added.</p>

<iframe src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_map.html" width="100%" height="550"></iframe>


<p><a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_map.html">Full screen view</a></p>

<p>One small drawback is that WebGL, the technology Tangram is based on, is not available for much of the windows world.
WebGL requires modern browsers (IE9 does not count) and also modern hardware/graphics card drivers. A couple of years
old windows machine will likely not be able to render WebGL no matter what browser you use. But the main target is
mobile, and iOS and most android won&rsquo;t have a problem with WebGL.</p>

<p>Only one problem left. OSM does not have and &ldquo;cycling comfort&rdquo; tags right now. There are two ways around that. One could
keep those tags in a separate file, but that becomes difficult to maintain when OSM features change. Or one can add the
tag to the OSM data. That way better bike maps can scale easily, and the information can also be used in OSM-based
routing services where their real value lies.</p>

<p>Not sure which is the way to go here, a similar tag
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/bike_safety">has been proposed before</a> but apparently did not
go anywhere. Looking at the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Any_tags_you_like">tag guidelines</a> the fact they these
new tags are very useful for routing seems to speak for adding them to OSM, but the fact that they are measuring
something explicitly non-geographic by going beyond the already existing physical infrastructure markers might mean
they are better kept in an external database. Will have to think this over, feedback appreciated.</p>

<h4>Where to go from here.</h4>

<p>The logical next step is to add routing. Again, Mapzen&rsquo;s <a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/valhalla/">flexible routing service</a>
seems to be a natural match. Also, adding editing capabilities right onto the map would be quite useful. The bike map is
where data issues are best seen, and saving the step to head over to OSM to fix it (after creating an account) and then
waiting for the data to update on the map seems like a workflow that will discourage wide participation.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/10/24/census-drilldown/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-24T20:45:16-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/10/24/census-drilldown</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Next steps in CensusMapper</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">Census Mapper Project</a> is moving along slowly, public beta unearthed some bugs and we gathered
feedback (thanks to everyone reporting back!). There are still a couple of steps that need to be taken care of before
we can unleash the full map making power to all users. We feel that the complexity of census data requires more guidance
than the current map making system is providing. Anyone who does not mind getting there hands dirty and having to look
up census variable definitions by themselves when making maps is welcome to contact us and we will hook you up with a
beta mapmaking account.</p>

<p>In the meantime we added one important feature to the CensusMapper.</p>

<h5>Content Drilldown</h5>

<p>CensusMapper is a great way to explore single census variables (or a single function built out of census variables)
across many geographic regions and aggregation levels. But sometimes we would like to do the opposite: Drill down into
a specific census region and explore other census variables. We have now added an easy way to do this. To access it
simply select the &ldquo;more&rdquo; button in the basic popup when you select a census region. This brings up the <em>census wheel</em>,
which is our way to navigate through census data.
<img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/wheel.png" alt="Census Wheel" /></p>

<p>Try it out right away on <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">CensusMapper</a> or read on for details on how this works.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are almost 4,000 census variables available, right now we do not offer to split up by gender, which reduces the
available variables to 1,429. To further simplify things we throw out all variables with zero values for the give
geographic area, still leaving a
sizeable number of variables to browse through.
<img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/mother_tounge.png" alt="Mother Tounge" style="max-width:400px;margin-right:15px;margin-top:10px;" align="left"/>
Each arc in the census wheel represents a variable, or a category of
variables. Selecting an arc will zoom into that arc and turn it into the &ldquo;center&rdquo; of the wheel, collapsing all other
components. That&rsquo;s the content <em>drilldown</em> process. Once it makes sense to display data as proportions, we switch to the
<em>proportional view</em> which shows the data as hierarchical pie chart.</p>

<p>This gives a visual representation of the proportions of each of the variables. Hovering (or touching) an arc will
display more detailed information, selecting one will drill down further. To reverse that process either select the
center or us the <em>content breadcrumbs</em> at the top that were created during the drilldown process.</p>

<h5>Data Problems</h5>

<p>Census data is messy. Now that all census data for each region is generally accessible in CensusMapper we need to
explain some of the inherent data problems.</p>

<h6>Rounding</h6>

<p>Census Canada will <a href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/help-aide/N2.cfm?Lang=E">round</a>
(almost) all data to preserve anonymity and don&rsquo;t create false impressions of accuracy that
the data does not achieve. Data is generally reported in increments of 5, rounding includes randomness to preserve
anonymity. The value of the measured value
is <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/DQ-QD/conf-eng.cfm">within 4</a> of the reported one. And
remember that even the measured variable is only an estimate of the actual value of the variable.
Rounding may lead to situations where, for example, the sum of all people listed
by age bracket will not add up to the total number of people. Generally, this difference will be small and we ignore it
in our visualization.</p>

<h6>Omitted Data</h6>

<p>Census Canada will at times not report data. This could be due to very low return rates or other problems that make data
so unreliable that it is better not reported at all. Or it could be that releasing the information could compromize
the anonymity of the census data for some people in that area. The latter can take
the form of Census Canada not reporting any data for the region, or Census Canada zeroing out specific variables that
&ldquo;are too low to be reported&rdquo;.
<img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/unaccounted.png" alt="Unaccounted" style="max-width:400px;margin-left:15px;margin-top:10px;" align="right"/>
We have not been able to find clear guidelines how the &ldquo;zeroing&rdquo; works, but often this will leave
detectable traces in the data. Looking at the example in the image, looking at &ldquo;Mode of Transport&rdquo; to work only
&ldquo;Driving&rdquo; has non-zero values, the
other options &ldquo;Passenger&rdquo;, &ldquo;Transit&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bike&rdquo;, &ldquo;Walk&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other&rdquo; are all zero. There were 160 people getting to work,
115 are listed as &ldquo;Driver&rdquo;, leaving 45 unaccounted for. This is outside of the range that could be explained by the
rounding of variables. We alert the user by adding in
a grey area for the missing 45. This also ensures that the visual representation remains accurate.</p>

<h6>Multiple Responses</h6>

<p>Some census questions allow for multiple responses. For exaple &ldquo;Language Spoken Most Often At Home&rdquo;. In this particular
case the census variable breaks out single responses and multiple responses and is very transparent to the user. In
other cases, for example &ldquo;Ethnicity&rdquo;, single and multiple responses are not reported separately but responses are all
added up. This leads to the sum of lower level variables being higher than the base variable. We alert the user to this
by overlaying small white dots on the base variable.
<img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/multiple_responses.png" alt="Multiple Responses" style="max-width:400px;margin-right:15px;margin-top:10px;" align="left"/>
In this particular case the total for for &ldquo;Ethnic Origin&rdquo; was 12,140 people. But there were 1,430 more responses at the
next level, so up to 1,430 people had given multiple responses to this question listing more than one of the aggregate
(mostly continent level) origins, some possibly listing more than two. The same patter repeats at different ethnic
origin aggregation
levels, for example 2,565 people claimed at least one of the &ldquo;British Island origins&rdquo;, but many listed more than one
resulting in the sum of the individual regions with the British Islands exceeding the British Island count by 1,445.
Again, we alert the user by overlaying dots over the &ldquo;British Island origins&rdquo; arc. Hovering over the arg will display
the exact numbers of the &ldquo;overcounting&rdquo; due to multiple responses.</p>

<p>In these cases where mulitple repsonses are not broken out the dots will aler the user that the proportional
representation in the hierarchical pie chart does not represent proportions out of a total given by the value of the
variable at the centre (or lower level), but as a proportion of all responses which exceeds the value of the
lower level variable.</p>

<h6>Basic Census</h6>

<p>The Basic Census is generally speaking quite reliable, every single person is required to fill it
out and return rates are generally above 95%. Serious problems will only occur if response rates are very low. We alert
the user by shading geographic regions is this has been the case.</p>

<h6>NHS</h6>

<p>The National Household Survey is quite different in nature, it was only
sent out to a smaller portion (~30%) of society and return rates were much lower (~69%). Even with 100% return rates
there are likely to be geographic regions where the results severely misrepresent reality in that region due to sampling
bias. For each region that bias is small, but the probability for bias grows as the number of people in the geographic
region declines. So this is mostly a problem for Dissemination Areas. But even there, the probability of severe sampling
bias in each region is small, but there are many regions and the probability that some of these regions suffer from
sever sampling bias is quite large.</p>

<p>On top of this basic statistical sampling bias, we also have self selection bias due to some deomgraphics being more
likely to return the survey than others. This bias is a product of the decision of scrapping the madatory
&lsquo;long form census&rsquo; and replacing it with the voluntary NHS. The return rates can give some indication of the
likelyhood of self-selection
bias, we shade regions with a non-return rate lower than 50%, the cutoff Census Canada set for reliability of the NHS.
It is especially problematic when trying to detect change in variables (for example poverty) from one census to another
as the differences in the variable over time are often small and similar in magnitude to possible self-selection bias.</p>

<p>The 50% cutoff we highlight in CensusMapper is just a guideline, the exact return rates are displayed on hover or when
selecting regions and should always to be taken into
account when interpreting results,
especially at the Dissemination Area level.</p>

<p>If all this information did not turn you off, head over to <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">CensusMapper</a> and drill down into
some geographic areas.</p>

    <updated>2015-09-28T09:23:41-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/09/28/census-mapper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h5>We are excited to announce CensusMapper public beta launch!</h5>

<p>The project on mapping census data for Canada is entering the next stage. We are now mapping 3875 different
variables from the 2011 census, or any combination of them, across 67215 geographic regions covering all of Canada.</p>

<p>We are opening up the <a href="http://censusmapper.ca">Census Mapper</a> to a limited public beta. Limited means that anyone
can view maps created in CensusMapper, but we are only opening up the map creation tools to selected beta users.</p>

<p>Be aware that the web app makes use of modern web technology and renders large amount of data. It will only work on
modern browsers, best viewed in Chrome or Safari. Firefox works ok, Internet Explorer might grind to a halt and should be avoided.</p>

<p><a href="http://censusmapper.ca"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/map-tools.jpg" alt="CenusMap Mapmaker" /></a></p>

<p>We are a little restrictive on creating maps right now for the simple reason that census data is somewhat tricky to
understand and at this point we don&rsquo;t have a comprehensive guide explaining all the variables and warning against many
of the pitfalls. We are planning to slowly integrate this and open up the map creation tools to the general public.</p>

<h3>Why CensusMapper?</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>Census Canada data is extremely rich and useful in many cirumstances, but it is not being widely used. There are many
reasons for this, the somewhat unmanageable amount of data being one of them, the difficulty of accessing and standardizing
the in principle freely available datasets is another.</p>

<p>Census data is inherently geographic in nature, working with the data without proper visualization tools can be challenging
too. And even for people that have good access to the data and that are well-versed in mapping geographic data, it can
still take quite a bit of time to generate maps visualizing the data. CensusMapper greatly speeds up this process by
allowing straightforward mapping of any function derived from census variables through all geographic aggregation levels
Canada wide.</p>

<h3>Storytelling</h3>

<p>Census mapper does more than just mapping census data. It is designed as a storytelling tool. Few maps are so crisp and
clear that they are self-explanatory. A map of population density might fall into that category. But most census variables
are sufficiently complex that maps derived from them warrant narration. We think of CensusMapper as a storytelling tool
that allows &lsquo;readers&rsquo; of the map to interact with it, zoom in, zoom out, pan around, and jump to other maps linked in the
story provided by the mapmaker.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<p>There are many ways to expand on this. On the map creation side we can offer more diverse coloring tools, allowing user
input and user defined map locations to be used in the mapping function, add data from previous census. We could allow
limited upload of user data to be integrated with census data, statistical and spacial analysis tools, custom mapping projects.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-25T23:18:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/08/25/the-hidden-mortgage</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some months ago I did a little side project and put some Census Canada data for Vancouver
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/census">on an interactive map</a> online. After it generated quite some interest, to a large part
due to Ian Young&rsquo;s reporting
<a href="http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1851003/bizarro-vancouver-25000-households-declare-less-income-they-spend">utilizing some of the data in the South China Morning Post</a>,
I talked to my friend Alejandro and we decided to set up a Census Mapper that allowes laymen to map any census variables
of their choosing Canada wide.</p>

<p>Since this is only a side project, it will take some time to set this up properly. In the meantime, I get to have some
fun to play with census data and map some variables of my choosing.</p>

<p>For a sneak preview of what the Census Mapper will be able to do read below the fold. No interaction, no chosing your
own variables and panning around Canada yet. Just some screenshots with a story to tie them together.</p>

<h3>Census Mapper Sneak Preview</h3>

<p>One of my many pet pieves has been the Drive Until You Qualify phrase. The idea is that you buy the house closest to your
place of work for which the bank will aprrove a loan. The obvious problem with this is that your commuting costs will
go up the further away from work you live &ndash; and you disposable income goes down accordingly. But the bank does not
seem to be bothered by that at all and often does not get much attention by househunting families either.</p>

<p>The fix? Easy. The cost of commuting and housing should not be separated by viewed in concert with one another.
People househunting right will have to do this based on their individual parameters, but let&rsquo;s take a look at what
choices people have made in the past based on Census Canada&rsquo;s 2011 NHS data.</p>

<h4>Dwelling Value</h4>

<p>In mapping terms, let&rsquo;s start with the map of Median Dwelling Values around Vancouver, taken from the NHS. Although
a little dated, it still serves to make the basic point.</p>

<p><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/dwelling_value.jpg" alt="&quot;Median Dwelling Value&quot;" /></p>

<p>The image is the familiar one, homes are expensive on the west side, a little less so toward the east. In Vancouver
proper the downtown area is somewhat affordable with prices dipping below $300,000 for the median dwelling. We are
considering the whole range, one bedroom condos all the way up to single family homes.</p>

<h4>Commute Time</h4>

<p>Next up, how much time to these people spend commuting? The NHS got you covered.</p>

<p><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/commute_time.jpg" alt="&quot;Median One Way Commute Time&quot;" /></p>

<p>The median one-way commute time give us a picture of how much time people spend to go to work. And we will assume they
spend the same time coming back.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to commute. We will think of the commute cost as being made up of two components. The money
spent to get to and from work and the dollar value of the time. That leaves us with two more questions. How much money
do people spent and how much is their time worth.</p>

<h4>Transportation Cost</h4>

<p>Luckily, again the NHS has something to say about this. To figure out the money spent on the commute we look at the mode
of transport. NHS tell us how many people drive, are passengers, take transit, cycle or walk to work. To keep things
simple we will compute the &lsquo;median commute cost&rsquo; by setting transit cost at $120 per month (roughly the price for a
2-zone transit pass) and for driving we set the car2go rate of 41c/min (which is quite generous, most people will spent
more if they own a car, and pay for gas, insurance, parking themselves and spent time to maintain it). For simplicit we
set the cost for passengers, cyclists and pedestrians at zero. So we sum over the number of drivers and transit users
and divide by the total number of commuters in each dissemination area to estimate that cost. Generally speaking it
turns out to be much smaller than the &lsquo;time cost&rsquo; calculated next.</p>

<h4>Time Cost</h4>

<p>To compute the &lsquo;time cost&rsquo; of commuting for the average person in each dissemination area we need to know what people&rsquo;s
time is worth. The NHS has a simple answer for that, the Median After Tax Household Income.</p>

<p><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/median_after_tax_income.jpg" alt="&quot;Median After Tax Household Income&quot;" /></p>

<p>We estimate the median annual time cost of the commute by taking the ratio of the daily commute time to the daily work time,
assumed to be eight hours, and multiplying it by the annual after tax income. That&rsquo;s more or less the money the average
person in that dissemination area makes in the time the person spent commuting. If there are several people in the
household contributing to the income, there will be several people spending time
commuting, so that effect roughly cancels out.</p>

<h4>Annual Commute Cost</h4>

<p>Putting it together we get the annual cost of the commute map.</p>

<p><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/commute_cost.jpg" alt="&quot;Annual Cost of Commute&quot;" /></p>

<p>This is only an estimate. From a technical perspective we probably should have been working with averages instead of
median values, but the result is very similar. Translating between time and money is inherintly tricky, most people can&rsquo;t
easily scale up or down the time they spent working to translate time into money. The easiest way to think of this is
someone who tries to work less hours (and get less pay) in order to spend more time with their family. One way to do
exactly that is to cut down on commute time.</p>

<h4>The Hidden Mortgage</h4>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to tie this back up with the price for housing. After all, the time you spent on your commute and your
mode choice for that commute, are intimately tied to where you choose to live. How do we combine the commute cost with
the housing cost?
As a rule of thumb, one makes $400 monthly payments for each $100,000 of mortgage. Give or take, but our numbers are
quite rough anyway. So taking the annual commute cost, dividing by 400 and multiplying by 100,000 we get the &lsquo;commute
cost mortgage equivalent&rsquo;. If we map it it looks the same as the previous map, just with different labels. But since I
like maps, here it is.</p>

<p><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/commute_mortgage_equivalent.jpg" alt="&quot;Commute Mortgage Equivalent&quot;" /></p>

<p>In other words, we translated the commute cost into &lsquo;hidden mortgage&rsquo; payments. Except, unlike a real mortgage, paying
it off does not generate any value for you.</p>

<h4>Combined Dwelling Value and Commute Cost</h4>

<p>Finally we have all we need for the end result. The Combined Dwelling Value and Commute Time/Mode Value Map where we
simply add the estimated commute mortgage cost onto the dwelling value.</p>

<p><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/combined_dwelling_commute.jpg" alt="&quot;Combined Dwelling Value And Commute Cost&quot;" /></p>

<p>It does not look radically different from the dwelling value map. It&rsquo;s almost the same around downtown where commute
time tends to be low and more expensive further out, where the &lsquo;hidden mortgage&rsquo; of commute time can add up to half a
million dollars.</p>

<p>Using Census Data can only help illustrate the hidden mortgage that people are already paying. It can only highlight
some general trends and ideas, it cannot make any statement about particular individual households, nor can the genral
reasoning used to derive the numbers apply to everyone. Or maybe even most people. The estimates are quite rough, likely
underestimating commute costs for drivers, not taking into account the well understood health benefits of active
transportation nor the negative health implications of driving. The commute time to money computation is very rough
and will have to be adjusted if applied to real-world examples. But this is only meant to illustrate ageneral point.</p>

<p>The takeaway should be that the &lsquo;hidden mortgage&rsquo; is real, and it&rsquo;s huge. And often overlooked.</p>

    <updated>2015-06-23T15:26:23-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/06/23/vancouver-2011-census-data-on-housing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week my friend Alejandro emailed me some census data. After sitting on it for a couple of days I decided one evening
to take a look and map the dissemination areas. The dataset contained 125 fields around housing and income. So I started
plucking some of the fields off the table and mapping them.</p>

<p>It did not take long and colorful maps started showing up. Another evening and lots of map layers later I put the
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/census">Vancouver Census Map</a> online
for people interested to look through the census graphs. The number of layers became a little unwieldly, just pick and
choose what you are interested in.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/census/?layer=17"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/affordability.jpg" alt="&quot;Affordability&quot;" /></a></p>

<h4>So what exactly does the Census Data show?</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>The data is aggregated at the Dissemination Area level and rounded to protect privacy. That leaves some artefacts, but
generally gives a very detailed picture of what is going on in different parts of the city. The biggest drawback is the
age, the data is now 4 to 5 years old. Lots of things happened in the meantime, we will have to wait until 2016 for the
next Census Canada dataset.</p>

<h4>Where to go from here?</h4>

<p>When I get around to it I might map all of Metro Van Census data. It won&rsquo;t take any time to re-run the import script for
the larger dataset, but I will need to show higher aggregation level data at lower zoom levels to keep it repsonsive
for slower machines, just like I did for the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">Vancouver Assessment Map</a></p>

<p>I should probably also take a look at what other fields are available, the &lsquo;affordability&rsquo; map linked above uses
individual income for full-time employees instead of combined household income, which differes from how affordability
is usually calculated. The reason is that the data I had did not have the household income. Not sure if it is available
at the dissemination area aggregation level, but if it is that one should be used. But I am lazy, so for now that&rsquo;s it.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/05/31/density-in-vancouver/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-31T22:44:55-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/05/31/density-in-vancouver</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I saw that Downtown brings in 23% of CoV tax revenue but only makes up 5% of the city area. Intrigued by that I decided to
add a &lsquo;Tax Density&rsquo; layer to my <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">Vancouver Assessment Map</a>.
The idea was to try and understand the tax revenue generated by different areas in Vancouver. The data is already available
in the CoV open data property dataset so it would only take half an hour to ad it to my map.</p>

<p><a href="http://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/tax_density.jpg" alt="&quot;Tax Density&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>There has been a lot of discussion around density in Vancouver. One aspect of density is that it will generally increase
the tax revenue that the city can collect per square metre. At the same time the city spending for services of the added
density increases at a much lower rate. Leaving a net gain of revenue for the city. As property taxes are
need-based, this means lower property taxes for everyone when density increases. In short, density leads to efficiency
increases that materialize in form of lower property taxes for everyone.</p>

<p>That also points to one possible way to break some of the resistance to density increases that Vancouver currently sees.
If a neighbourhood (or smaller region) accepts density increases, maybe some of the associated benefits
of lower property taxes should be applied locally instead of everything being spread out over the entire city.</p>

<h4>So what exactly does the Tax Density layer show?</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>The Tax Density I mapped is simply the amount of taxes collected per m&sup2;.
Under that measure, Downtown comes out at $127.1/m&sup2;, followed by the West End at $72.7/m&sup2; and Fairview at
$42.7/m&sup2;. The Vancouver average is $20/m&sup2;, only 6 of the 23 neighbourhoods have an above-average Tax Density.
A complete list of Tax Density by neighbourhood is at the bottom.</p>

<p>For this calculation I did not count the parks doward the area of
the neighbourhoods, but school for example are included. In light of this some of the aggregated data should be viewed
with caution.</p>

<h4>Where to go from here?</h4>

<p>I also thought about mapping the density of housing units, but sadly the data in the CoV open data catalogue is ill-suited to
do this. I can easily extract the number of tax entities and map the density of these. This works great for a traditional
single family home (one tax entity) and for stratas (one tax entity per unit), but it becomes a problem because e.g. laneway
houses and granny suites don&rsquo;t show up as separate tax entities. And it gets really bad with rental apartments, where the
whole building will be a single tax entity with potentially a very large number of units. And then the dataset does not
distinguish between commercial and residential units. That data could be reverse engineered from the tax data, but that&rsquo;s
more work than my usual half hour tolerance level for this kind of side project.</p>

<p>Another option is to use census data and merge the datasets. But that gets messy, the aggregation levels don&rsquo;t match and
this is well beyond a side project time frame.</p>

<p>Similarly, it would be interesting to map the changes in tax density and the changes in unit density in Vancouver, but
again the CoV dataset does hold the necessary information. In particular, when properties get a new tax coordinate (for
example when they get re-developed) the CoV dataset drops the old tax data associated with that physical location. This
makes it impossible to map the changes in tax density that redevelopment has brought.</p>

<p>Long story hort, if you are interested in browsing Vancouver by tax revenue collected per square meter, click through to
the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">Vancouver Assessment Map</a> and select the Tax Density layer.</p>

    <link href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/04/01/bike-paths/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-01T16:24:34-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/04/01/bike-paths</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Motivated by the excellent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/01/bleak-maps-of-how-cities-look-using-only-their-bike-lanes/">Washington Post Wonkblog</a> I
mapped Vancouver&rsquo;s bike infrastructure. Looks good at first, but when you take out the &lsquo;fake&rsquo; &ldquo;Local Street&rdquo; bikeways more in line with Wonkblog&rsquo;s methodology it&rsquo;s looking pretty
bleak in large portions of the city.</p>

<p>Of course the devil is in the details and infrastructure cannot just be judged by how it&rsquo;s labeled. If one were to look for 8-80 infrastructure, then the separated lanes
would make the cut. Some of the bike lanes would be marginal, but most would probably make the cut. Although I can&rsquo;t say that I would be particularly keen to let an 8yo cycle on
some of them.</p>

<p>Vancouver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shared Lanes&rdquo; are not for the faint of heart. They have 50 speed limits on multi-lane roadways
and feature sharrows to make it a little easier for cyclists to &lsquo;take the lane&rsquo;. In some cases cyclists share a lane with
the buses, which is a little better.</p>

<p>The local streets are mostly car tunnels like the &lsquo;Off-Broadway&rsquo; and won&rsquo;t qualify as 8-80, but there are some exceptions like
the local street portion of Pt. Grey Rd, where cycling is rather pleasant.</p>

<p><a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths.html">Full screen view</a></p>

<p>Methodology is simple, it&rsquo;s just the city&rsquo;s bike path data from <a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">their open data catalogue</a>. The data
comes with two fields, &lsquo;name&rsquo; and &lsquo;type&rsquo;. The &lsquo;type&rsquo; was used for the checkboxes at the bottom to selectively turn different
bike lane types on or off and the &lsquo;name&rsquo; will be displayed on hover.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<h4>Some more <strike>Canadian</strike> cities:</h4>

<p><a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths?city=Calgary,street&amp;type=BICYCLE_CL&amp;dataUrl=http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/data/CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.geojson">Calgary on street</a>,

<p>A word of caution. I have done zero data cleaning or verification. Some of these maps are missing some type of infrastructure.
I am familiar with cycling conditions in Calgary, and their the extensive network along the river and other areas are missing in their main file.
I added two more separate maps for their trails and pathways, but was too lazy to merge them. For Taipei, I noticed that
the off-street paths along streets are missing, for example the one on Dunhua Bei Lu that I was using a lot a year ago. Not sure if or where these are available.
So some more ground truth is needed for proper interpretation. But fun anyway.</p>

<p>Want to map another city&rsquo;s data? No problem, just read on.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ol>
<li>Locate the city&rsquo;s bikeway data and download it.</li>
<li>Convert the data to geojson, with coordinates in latitude and longitude.</li>
<li>Put the geojson file online somewhere, e.g. your public dropbox folder.</li>
<li>Optionally look at the geojson file for a bikeway type descriptor and bikeway name, if available.</li>
<li>Build a url for your map by using [<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths">http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths</a>] as a base url and add query strings

<ul>
<li><code>dataUrl=&lt;url to your geojson&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>city=&lt;city name&gt;</code></li>
<li>optionally <code>type=&lt;bikeway type property&gt;</code></li>
<li>optionally <code>name=&lt;bikeway name property&gt;</code></li>
<li>optionally <code>zoom=true</code> if you want to be able to zoom and pan on the map</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, to map Calgary&rsquo;s bike network you need to <a href="https://data.calgary.ca/opendata/Pages/DatasetListingAlphabetical.aspx#C">got to their open data website</a> and
download the Tranportation Bikeways shapefiles (SHP). To convert them go geojson using <code>ogr2ogr</code></p>

<pre><code>ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -simplify 1 -s_srs CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.prj -t_srs "EPSG:4326" CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.geojson CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.shp
</code></pre>

<p>from the <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries">GDAL package</a>.</p>

<p>I uploaded the geojson to <code>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/data/CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.geojson</code>, so that will be the value of the <code>dataUrl</code> query string.</p>

<p>Looking at the resulting geojson file you will see that the data does not include bikeway names, but it does include
types and the property is called <code>BICYCLE_CL</code>.</p>

<p>The rather lengthy link to the map would then be
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths?city=Calgary&amp;type=BICYCLE_CL&amp;dataUrl=http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/data/CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.geojson">http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths?city=Calgary&amp;type=BICYCLE_CL&amp;dataUrl=http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/data/CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.geojson</a></p>

<iframe src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths?city=Calgary&type=BICYCLE_CL&fh=50&nh=true&dataUrl=http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/data/CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.geojson" width="100%" height="580"></iframe>


<p>Or if you want to zoom into Calgary&rsquo;s sprawling suburbs, you could also enable zooming (using double-click) and panning
<a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths?city=Calgary&amp;type=BICYCLE_CL&amp;zoom=true&amp;dataUrl=http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/data/CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.geojson">http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/bike_paths?city=Calgary&amp;type=BICYCLE_CL&amp;zoom=true&amp;dataUrl=http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/data/CALGIS_TRAN_BIKEWAY.geojson</a></p>

<p>Happy Mapping!</p>

    <updated>2015-03-23T16:20:43-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/03/23/vancouver-assessment-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The City of Vancouver has recently
updated <a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">their open data catalogue</a> with historic tax
data. We figured that would
be a good time to take our previous rather clumsy attempts to map tax data and polish that up a bit.</p>

<p>This time we put in a couple of evenings to build a more responsive map with multiple options of what to map. Head
straight for <a href="http://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">&lsquo;the map&rsquo;</a> or read on for some background information, including
some methodology on data cleaning and interpolation.</p>

<p><a href="http://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment"><img src="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/images/land_value.jpg" alt="&quot;Land Values&quot;" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Our previous <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/teardown_map.html">&lsquo;teardown map&rsquo;</a> and <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/teardown_map.html">&lsquo;high value map&rsquo;</a> suffered from being a static
websites, and they loaded large amounts of data all at once, 30,000 properties for the teardown map, and display
the all at once. Options were limited for displaying more detailed data when selecting individual properties.
For the viewer this resulted more in an exercise of patience than in an &lsquo;interactive&rsquo; experience.</p>

<p>We decided to remedy this by importing the CoV data into a database and chop the data up dynamically and serve it as vector tiles.
For smaller zoom levels we aggregated data at the block level. There are lots of blocks in Vancouver, 4444 that contain
properties with tax information to be precise. So again the map is a little sluggish on mobile devices and slower machines when zoomed out,
but things get much faster as we zoom in.</p>

<p>Moreover, we now have the ability to easily display more detailed information once the use selects an individual
property or block aggregate. We can display a graph with the development of land and building values and other details.
And we integrated google streetview for good measure.</p>

<p>One issue that came up is that CoV historical data has lots of gaps. For example, when a particular property was
re-developed it gets a new tax number. The tax information for the old property is lost and cannot be connected to the
geographic site using the information provided by CoV. So when we display data showing &lsquo;value change&rsquo; between
2006 and 2014 we color these properties in grey. This problem persists when we aggregate information at the block level.
To avoid greying out lots of blocks we extrapolate the missing data by using citywide averages on growth rates
of land and building values for the properties in question. This will likely underestimate the aggregate growth in building
and land value, but will not have a big impact at the block level if the individual property value in question was
comparatively small. But this was not always the case. Better analysis could solve some of these issues, so does
zooming in to the individual property level.</p>

<p>Another issue is that CoV does not provide historic zoning information. It would be interesting to get historic zoning
and development permit information. Some of this data is already available, albeit not in an easily consumable form.</p>

<p>Other than that a big thanks to the folks maintaining the CoV open data catalogue!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After reading the <a href="http://pricetags.wordpress.com/2014/11/04/the-daily-durning-back-and-forth-on-cacs/">post on Price Tags</a>,
originally from <a href="http://karensawatzky.ca/2014/10/29/7868/">Karen Sawatzky&rsquo;s blog</a>, I got curious about getting a
geographic overview over the CACs in Vancouver in 2010, 2011 and 2012.</p>

<p>As opposed to the <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2014/09/05/vancouver-teardown-map/">teardown map</a> the dataset is quite small, so there should
be no problems viewing this on a mobile device. As always, map is below the fold.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Some of the property addresses did not match any address in the CoV open data property database, probably because the
developments are quite new and new addresses got assigned. In these cases I mapped the CAC property to a nearby property
and added the &lsquo;Mapped Address&rsquo; field in the info pane. Enjoy.</p>

    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2014/09/07/vancouver-high-value-improvements-map</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2014/09/05/vancouver-teardown-map/">teardown map</a> that looked at the low end of Vancouver&rsquo;s building
stock, a natural question is to look at the high end. Just as before, we are focusing on the (assessed) value of the
building relative to the total (assessed) value of land and improvements. We defined &ldquo;highly improved&rdquo; properties to
be properties where the ratio is at least 50%, so the building is worth at least as much as the land it is built on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s actually a pretty high bar in Vancouver, less than 1500 buildings pass that muster. And in concordance with the
teardown map, the &ldquo;high value improvements&rdquo; seem to concentrate in downtown. See the map below the fold
to explore for yourself.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When browsing the map it becomes clear that some properties have &ldquo;high value improvements&rdquo; because of an abnormally low
land value, rather than an abnormally high improvement value. This is probably due to intricacies of zoning in Vancouver
that maybe someone else can shed some light on.</p>

    <id>http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2014/09/05/vancouver-teardown-map</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been lots of talk about old homes being torn down and replaced in Vancouver. The likeliest targets are houses
of relatively low value sitting on expensive land. So how many teardown candidates are there in Vancouver, and where
in Vancouver are they located?</p>

<p>To answer this we use data from <a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">Vancouver&rsquo;s open data catalogue</a>
to build an interactive map to explore the low end of the building stock. More specifically, we set a somewhat arbitrary
ratio of (assessed) house value to total (assessed) property value (house + land) of 5% and label everything below that
a &ldquo;teardown candidate&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The short answer is that almost one in three properties in Vancouver fall into this category. And they are distributed
quite evenly across all of Vancouver with some areas like downtown looking a little better.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>On the level of the individual property the &ldquo;teardown candidate&rdquo; designation might be unfair and somewhat inflammatory.
By our above definition, a million dollar house sitting on a 20 million dollar property is a &ldquo;teardown candidate&rdquo;. In
some cases BC Assessment may have failed to properly account for recent renovations resulting in the building being
undervalued and more likely to show up as a &ldquo;teardown candidate&rdquo;. And of course not every &ldquo;teardown candidate&rdquo; will be
torn down, other options may be preferable. Depending on circumstance extensive renovations may be the better option,
and the pervasiveness of &ldquo;teardown candidates&rdquo; suggest that many people in Vancouver are happy living in a house that
is worth less than 5% of the overall assessed value of the property.</p>

<p>To aid a more individualized look at properties we included the address, the assessed land and improvement values, the
tax levy (CoV just added this information a couple of days ago), zoning information, the land area and the relative land
value. To display this information just hover your mouse over a property (or touch it on your mobile device). Opening a
second browser with a map with satellite imagery (or Apple maps) can provide additional context.</p>

<p>Take a look at the map and explore for yourself. You will need a reasonably fast computer and modern
browser to enjoy the map, it contains lots of data and may feel quite slow on mobile devices.</p>
