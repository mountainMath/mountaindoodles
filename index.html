  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today the City of Vancouver <a href="http://council.vancouver.ca/20160308/documents/rr1presentation.pdf">released their report</a>
on unoccupied dwelling units in the city. I watched part of the presentation and read through the report, and from all
that I can see the methodology used is very solid.</p>

<p>I have seen some confusion and even some incorrect reporting on this, so I thought it would be worthwhile to look into
the report in detail.</p>

<h3>The Data</h3>

<p>Smart meter data can be used to determine very accurately which units
are occupied and which ones are not. In theory at least, in practice this is quite difficult because of the shier magnitude
of the data. That&rsquo;s why this is best left to companies who specialize in this kind of analysis, which is exactly what the
city has done.</p>

<p>The only problem is that not all units have smart meters. I don&rsquo;t know how far BCHydro has come with their rollout, but
most condo units should have smart meters by now, as do newer single family units. So what to do about the housing that
does not have smart meters? That&rsquo;s where things get tricky. Some studies I have seen use cutoffs for monthly electricity
consumption to determine which are unoccupied. The problem is to find the right cutoff. Typically these studies report
rates computed using several cutoffs to address that uncertainty. The problem is that different cutoffs give very different
results. For example, <a href="http://www.btaworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/btaworks_condo_study_report_final2.pdf">this study</a>
looked at 75kWh and 100kWh as cutoffs and reported 5.5% and 8.5% unoccupancy rate, respectively. I checked my condo unit
when it was unoccupied for two months one summer, my two fridges pushed me well above the 100kWh threshold. So my unoccupied
unit would have been counted as occupied in this study.</p>

<p>So how did the new study deal with this problem. We did not hear technical details, but during the presentation it was
explained that smart meter data was used to &ldquo;train&rdquo; a model to use dumb meter data. That&rsquo;s exactly the right approach. Going
by the fact that everything was done right I am reasonably comfortable to assume that this part was also done in a way to
give accurate aggregate numbers.</p>

<p>I am hoping that the technical report will still come out so we can be confident that the details were taken care of
properly. In particular I would like to know how the model dealt with differnt housing types, how the housing type
was tied to the electricity bill. And what the ratio of dwellings of each housing type had smart meter data available.</p>

<p>Bottom line on data: Solid.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The big takeaway is this one graph:</p>

<p><img  src="/images/unoccupied-trends.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
It shows that no matter what timeframe is used to define &ldquo;unoccupied&rdquo;, the rate stayed flat over time. In context of
the current affordability discussion this means that this is unlikely a driving factor of Vancouver&rsquo;s skyrocketing
real estate prices. But the absolute numbers are still quite large and there is a lot of untapped potential. While some people
have argued that supply has not been the main part of the cause of the price hike in Vancouver, it is clear that it must
be a big part of any solution. Finding effective ways to get this untapped supply online should be a priority, it is easier
and more efficient than building new housing in NIMBY-zoned Vancouver.</p>

<p>The other takeaway is that unoccupied units are dominated by condos.</p>

<p><img  src="/images/unoccupied-apartment.png" style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
The graph shows the rate for apartments, which also includes purpose built rentals. As the report points out, if we
take out the purpose-built rentals, which have vacancy rates well below 1% at any given time and are extremely unlikely
to stay vacant for two or more months, we arrive at a rate of about 12.5% of condos that are unoccupied in the City of
Vancouver. As should be expected, that&rsquo;s significantly higher than what the non-smart meter studies picked up.</p>

<h3>Are rates in Vancouver higher than elsewhere?</h3>

<p>That depends exactly on what the question asks. And this is where, in my opinion, the city report fails to give a good
answer.</p>

<p><img  src="/images/unoccupied-apartment-comparison.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;">
The City implied, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/vancouvers-vacant-homes-in-line-with-other-cities-but-condos-most-likely-empty/article29072573/">and newspapers now report</a>
that Vancouver numbers are &ldquo;in line&rdquo; with other comparable cities. That claim is based on this graphic,
which is included in the report and stems from a <a href="http://www.urbanfutures.com/foreign-unoccupied/">study by Urban Futures</a>.
The study shows that the Metro Vancouver&rsquo;s rate of unoccupied apartments is not much different from other Metro regions.</p>

<p>The problem is that this study is read as giving the <em>overall</em> occupancy rates are similar across metro regions, which is not
the case. This is a fine point and a little technical, let&rsquo;s take a look at the actual rates of unoccupied dwellings in
the larges metro areas.</p>

<div id="unoccupied_cma" class="land_use" style="width:300px;float:right"></div>


<p>We took these numbers from a <a href="http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/odpub/pdf/68323.pdf?lang=en">CMHC report</a> that looked into this
question and used the same data and methodology as Urban Futures, except they based it on all dwelling units instead of
just apartments. This difference is quite stunning, and it can be explained by the fact that e.g. Metro Vancouver&rsquo;s
housing units are to 41% apartments, vs 20% for Metro Calgary. And that various reports showed that the
rate of unoccupied units is much higher in condos, so we can&rsquo;t substitute comparisons for unoccupied apartments for comparisons
of unoccupied dwellings overall.</p>

<p>So what do the numbers look like when comparing the City of Vancouver to other cities in the region and across Canada.
In short, I do not know. Without going into too much details, the number of unoccupied dwelling units is derived by taking the number of
units that are &ldquo;not occupied by usual residents&rdquo;, which is part of the standard release of the census data, and subtracting
the &ldquo;unusual residents&rdquo;, that is foreign or temporary residents. So residents that have a permanent address abroad or
elsewhere in Canada and on Census day occupied in a dwelling unit that is not their primary residents. Think students
in a dorm room. Or someone in his vacation home. Or someone that works far from home and has a second unit close to work.</p>

<p>And to get the number of foreign or temporary residents requires a custom tabulation, which costs some time and money. But
overall not that much compared to the scope of the study the city just undertook, so it is not clear why they did not do this
and settle this question properly.</p>

<h3>Why do I see so many different unoccupancy rates?</h3>

<p>Again, that depends exactly on the question asked. The report offers a variety of different rates, using the definition
of unoccupied for 2 months, 6 months or 12 months. Each one gives a different rate. Then there is also the definitions
used by Stats Canada, the building being unoccupied on census day (and the questionnaire was not returned).
Again resulting in a differnt number. Then we can throw in the &ldquo;unusual residents&rdquo;, getting yet another number. Confused?
You should be! Difficult questions often don&rsquo;t have an easy answer.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to be consistent when comparing these numbers. Has the problem gotten worse? Use numbers that
were derived using the same methodology at different times. Is is worse here than elsewhere? Use numbers derived using
the same methodology across geographies.</p>

<h3>Geographic distribution</h3>

<p><a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/104" target="_blank"><img  src="/images/unoccupied.png" style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px;"></a>
In absence of the data on the foreign and temporary residents, we can take a closer look at the publicly released census
data on &ldquo;dwellings not occupied by usual residents&rdquo;. The percentage of dwellings occupied by foreign or temporary residents
are quite low, in the 0.4% to 0.2% range for these metro areas we looked at above. They tend to cluster around universities,
but may also accumulate in some other areas. Keeping that in mind we can <a href="http://censusmapper.ca/maps/104">head over to CensusMapper</a>
and zoom, pan around and use the search bar to explore the geographic distribution. The city data has shown that there
was not much change in the number of unoccupied dwellings over time, no matter how the data was sliced. That gives us
some confidence that the geographic distribution has also been somewhat stable over that time frame.</p>

<p>At CensusMapper we are working on adding previous censuses, so this will be a good test case to see how the 2006 and 2001
geographic distribution of unoccupied dwellings stacks up.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>The city study settles an important questions. The rates of unoccupied homes have not gone up. Perceptions often don&rsquo;t
match facts. And there are lots of little things to poke at of course. What about people having a cleaning person stop
by every other week? How about homes awaiting renovation or demolition permits? How about AirBnB?</p>

<p>Now all these are valid questions. But before using this to discount the study do some estimates to see how large of an effect
your porposed hole actually has. How does it compare to the number of units that were found unoccupied and how would it
change that rate? In all these cases it is quite small. Then ask yourself how likely it is that the problem would be growing.</p>

<p>Then you find that AirBnB probably needs more scrutiny. Best current estimates that I have seen
<a href="https://twitter.com/karensawa/status/707288630444699650">peg entire units rented fulltime at AirBnB at 1200 in Vancouver</a>.
Counting those would bring the rates of units taken out of the rental market by being unoccupied for a year or rented out
full time via AirBnB from 4.8% to 5.3%. Noticeable, but doesn&rsquo;t make that much of a difference. Yet. That number is
very likely to grow if left unchecked and should probably be taken seriously and regulated properly right now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was curious how the physical parameters of Single Family Houses changed over time.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">assessment dataset</a> merged with the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/land_use/map">land use dataset</a>
allows to fairly accurately pick out single family houses, and also holds the age of most properies. Together with
the City of Vancouver LIDAR-generated building dataset <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/vancouver_lidar/map">that I have played with before</a>
we can look at physical building parameters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I started thinking about <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2015/05/31/density-in-vancouver/">tax density</a>,
the amount of property taxes collected per area, I always felt that the data presentation in the map fell short.</p>

<p>Property taxes are somewhat insulated from the ups and downs of the real estate market as they are need-based and the mill
rate changes to flatten out the crazyness of the market. But what they lack in interesting patterns over time they more than
makes up for in interesting patterns in space.</p>

<p>To recognize these spacial patterns, one needs to switch layers in my
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=14&amp;lat=49.2741&amp;lng=-123.1321&amp;layer=10">assessment maps</a> and that&rsquo;s
a little awkward and most people won&rsquo;t do this.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember where I first saw some 3D data visualization around something like this, maybe in
<a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/11/18/mapping-the-effects-of-parking-minimums">this excellent Strong Towns post</a> that
explores tax density and parking.
When I was chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/dnproulx">Darren Proulx</a> about this I realized this is the perfect case
to rev up <a href="https://mapzen.com">Mapzen&rsquo;s awesone 3D map engine</a> for data visualization. Previously I had tried out the 3D
mapping capabilities to map
<a href="https://mountainmath.ca/vancouver_lidar/map">the physical form of Vancouver&rsquo;s buildings obtained from LIDAR data</a>,
now it was time to map abstract data in 3D.</p>

someone asked a question about space dedicated to roads, and how that could be unlocked
to aid housing. He mentioned what percentage of space is currently dedicated to roads. I forgot the number,
but I thought to myself that I should look that up for all Metro Vancouver communities. So here we go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots has been said about the upper end of owned dwellings. The movement of the &ldquo;million dollar line&rdquo;, the emergence of
the &ldquo;two million dollar line&rdquo; and &ldquo;multi-million dollar lines&rdquo;. Most of that discussion is focused on
<a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=sfh" target="_blank">single detached homes</a> or on proxies for &ldquo;single detached&rdquo; like
<a href="http://www.mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?filter=rs" target="_blank">RS zoned properties</a>.</p>

<p>But all of these maps have a clear bias toward the more expensive homes. Everyone knows by now where the most expensive properties
are. But where are the more affordable ones?</p>

Metro Vancouver has a <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/data">fairly good land use dataset</a> that I imported quite some time
ago so that <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/land_use/map">I could take a good look at it</a>. But then I forgot about it until
<a href="https://twitter.com/HealthyCityMaps">@HealthyCityMaps</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HealthyCityMaps/status/692832946714050564">reminded me</a> just
at the time when the discussions about <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">assessmened values</a> in Vancouver were flaring up again.</p>

<p>So finally I decided to mark up the City of Vancouver assessment dataset with the land use from the Metro Vancouver land
use dataset. And I used the occasion to update my color schemes from two years ago and gave it a dark background that
works better with the <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org">colorbrewer</a> palettes.</p>

<p>The result of the land use and assessment data mashup is a much better understanding what kind of properties we have right now in Vancouver.</p>

the ongoing debade on affordability of housing in the City of Vancouver we regularly hear voices expressing concern for

to argue against doing anything to ease the housing affordability problems many (younger) people are facing. In these
arguments the concern for &ldquo;elderly folks of modest means&rdquo; seems curiously focused to those who own property as opposed to,
for example, the 20% of the elderly people in Vancouver that live in poverty (15k total).</p>

<p>Which got me a little thinking about &ldquo;earning money&rdquo; in this day and age.</p>

On the heels of the <a href="http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/17/updated-vancouver-assessment-data/">new assessment data</a> we
can start to slice the data in different ways to understand various aspects of the real estate landscape in Vancouver. The
fact that <a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">Vancouver Open Data</a> makes historic data available
gives the ability to look for changes over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">Our maps</a> explore this by visualizing some aspects of these changes for all
properties, but it might also be useful to filter the properties we show to focus in on specific criteria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teardowns&rdquo; always triggers lots of emotions in Vancouver. Without looking at the emotional side and trying to avoid any
judgement we will
investigate the data to understand what buildings have been torn down recently and predict which buildings will get torn
down next. And map them. Long story short, we predict that
1 in 6 buildings <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/special/17?layer=4">on this map</a> (and then some more with lower teardown probability)
will get torn down and rebuilt by 2026.</p>

The friendly folks at
<a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx">Vancouver Open Data</a> just
<a href="https://twitter.com/VanOpenData/status/688060388190097408">updated their property assessment data</a> with the fresh 2016
property tax assessments. Time to run the script to update the <a href="https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment">Vancouver Assessment Map</a>
with the new data. And for good measure I pasted over some of the thematic map engine from <a href="https://censusmapper.ca">CensusMapper</a>
to improve the mapping performance.</p>
